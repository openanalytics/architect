Currently supported output targets include the X Window System (via both Xlib and XCB), Quartz, Win32, image buffers, PostScript, PDF, and SVG file output. Experimental backends include OpenGL, BeOS, OS/2, and DirectFB. Cairo is designed to produce consistent output on all output media while taking advantage of display hardware acceleration when available (eg. through the X Render Extension). The cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing operators of PostScript and PDF. Operations in cairo including stroking and filling cubic BÃ©zier splines, transforming and compositing translucent images, and antialiased text rendering. All drawing operations can be transformed by any affine transformation (scale, rotation, shear, etc.) Cairo is implemented as a library written in the C programming language, but bindings are available for several different programming languages. </TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="1213094">texmf\miktex\bin\x64\MiKTeX210200-cairo.dll texmf\tpm\packages\miktex-cairo-bin-x64-2.9.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1613855483</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>49298e26acdcbcfbb31e5603a3318ebb</TPM:MD5><TPM:Copyright owner="University of Southern California et al." year="2002-2014"/><TPM:License type="lgpl2.1"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
