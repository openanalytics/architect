XeTeX supports many extensions that reflect its origins in linguistic research; it also supports micro-typography (as available in pdfTeX). XeTeX was developed by the SIL (the first version was specifically developed for those studying linguistics, and using Macintosh computers). XeTeXâ€™s immediate output is an extended variant of DVI format, which is ordinarily processed by a tightly bound processor (called xdvipdfmx), that produces PDF. XeTeX is developed as a part of TeX Live; documentation has arisen separately. Source code is available from ctan:/systems/texlive/source.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="392733">texmf\fonts\misc\xetex\fontmapping\tex-text.map texmf\fonts\misc\xetex\fontmapping\tex-text.tec texmf\scripts\xetex\perl\lib\PDF\Reuse\Util.pm texmf\scripts\xetex\perl\lib\PDF\Reuse.pm texmf\scripts\xetex\perl\xdv2pdf_mergemarks.pl texmf\tex\generic\xetexconfig\unicode-letters.tex texmf\tex\xelatex\xetexconfig\crop.cfg texmf\tex\xelatex\xetexconfig\geometry.cfg</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1478379674</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>8a5875978173eaba1f4e36f78b52ea33</TPM:MD5><TPM:License type="other-free"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
