\Configure{PROLOG}.........1

   #1 Comma separated list of hooks to appear before HTML.

      Each hook E is declared to be configurable by an
      instruction of the form \NewConfigure{E}{1}

      A star '*' prefix calls for accumulative configurations

   Example:

      \Configure{PROLOG}{VERSION,DOCTYPE,*XML-STYLESHEET}
      \Configure{VERSION}
         {\HCode{<?xml version="1.0"?>}}

\Configure{ext}............1

   #1: default extension name for target files  (recorded in \:html)

   Can also be requested through a command line option ext=...

\Preamble...................0

   Records the list of the requested options.  Defined upon entering
   the environment \Preamble{...}....\EndPreamble, to replace the
   earlier version of \Preamble.

\ifOption ................. 3

   #1  Argument to be checked  wheteher it is a given option.

Wrapper for the Document
------------------------

\Configure{DOCTYPE}.........1
\Configure{HTML}............2
\Configure{HEAD}............2
\Configure{@HEAD}...........1
\Configure{BODY}............2
\Configure{TITLE+}..........1
\Configure{TITLE}...........2
\Configure{@TITLE}..........1
\Configure{Preamble}........2

    <DOCTYPE>
    <HTML 1>
      <HEAD 1>
         <TITLE 1>
            <@TITLE>
            <TITLE+>
         <TITLE 2>
         <@HEAD>
      <HEAD 2>
      <BODY 1>
      ......
      <BODY 2>
    <HTML 2>

The \Configure{@HEAD}{...} command is additive, concatenating the
content of all of its appearances.  An empty parameter requests
the cancellation of the earlier contributions.

For instance,

  \Configure{@HEAD}{A}
  \Configure{@HEAD}{}
  \Configure{@HEAD}{B}
  \Configure{@HEAD}{C}

contributes `BC'.

The \Configure{TITLE+} provides the content for the title,
\Configure{TITLE} sets the envelop, and \Configure{@TITLE} acts as a
hook for introducing localized configurations. As is the case for
\Configure{@HEAD}, the contribution of \Configure{@TITLE} is also
additive.

These configurations should be introduced early enough in the
compilation. For instance, in the case of LaTeX, between \Preamble
and \begin{document} of a local configuration file.

           \Preamble
             %%% here %%%
           \begin{document}
             ...
           \EndPreamble


\Configure{@BODY}...........1
\Configure{@/BODY}..........1

   Variants of \Configure{@HEAD} which contribute their content,
   respectively, after <body> and before </body>.

\Configure{CutAtTITLE+}.....1
\Configure{HPageTITLE+}.....1

   #1 an insertion just before the content of <TITLE>;

   If #1 is a one parametric macro, it gets the title content for
   an argument.


Support for Sectioning Commands
-------------------------------

\Configure{unit-name} ......................4

   #1 start
   #2 end
   #3 before title
   #4 after title

   Example:

        \Configure{section}
           {\HCode{<section>}}    {\HCode{</section>}}
           {\HCode{<title>}}      {\HCode{</title>}}


\ConfigureMark{unit-name}...................1

   Defines a macro \<<unit-name>>HMark to hold the given argument.
   Upon entering the unit, \TitleMark gets the content of this macro.

   Some built-in configurations of TeX4ht require an argument for the
   \<<unit-name>>HMark commands. For safety, these commands should
   always be followed by a, possiblely empty, argument.  The argument
   should be a separator between the title mark and its content.

   Example:

        \Configure{section}
           {}{}
           {\HCode{<h3>}\TitleMark\space}    {\HCode{</h3>}}
        \ConfigureMark{section}{\thesection}


\Configure{toTocLink}.......................2

   Each unit title contains a \Link{...}{...}...\EndLink command.
   The first argument of \Link points to the first table of contents
   referencing the title. The second argument provides an anchor
   for references to the title (mainly from tables of contents).

   The package option `section+' requests the inclusion of the
   title within the anchor.  Without this option, the link command
   resides between the title mark and its content.

   The \Configure{toTocLink} command is provided for configuring
   the \Link and \EndLink  instructions.  In the default setting,
   when the `sections+' option is not activated, the \Link
   command is altered to replace its first argument with an empty
   argument.

     Example:

          \Configure{toTocLink}
             {\Link}
             {\ifx \TitleMark\sectionHMark
                \Picture[\up]{haut.jpg align="right"}%
                \EndLink
                \TitleMark\space
              \else \EndLink \fi
             }
          \def\up{[up]}

\Configure{toToc}...........................2

    #1  unit type
    #2  desired contents type  (if empty, `unit type' is assumed)

  Example: \Configure{toToc}{chapter}{likechapter}
           Introduces chapter as likechapter into toc

    #1  empty: stop adding entries of `unit type' to toc
            @: add entries of `unit type' to toc
            ?: resume mode in effect before the last stop
    #2  unit type

  Example: \Configure{toToc}{}{chapter}
           \chapter{...}
           \Configure{toToc}{@}{chapter}

\Configure{writetoc}.........................1

    #1  Configuration material for the insertion instruction.
        New configurations are added to those request earlier
        by the command.  An empty argument cancels the earlier
        contributions.

\NoLink.......................1

   Ignore option `section+' for sections of type #1

\TitleCount

   Count of entries submitted to the toc file

\Configure{NoSection}.........2

   Insertions around the parameters of sectioning commands, applied when
   the parameters are not used to create titles for the divisions.


\CutAt{#1,#2,#3,...}

    #1           section type to be placed in a separate web page
    #2,#3,...    end delimiting section types, other than #1, for
                 the web pages
    A `+' before #1 requests hypertext buttons for the web pages

    Examples:

          \CutAt{mychapter,myappendix,mypart}
          \CutAt{+myappendix,mychapter,mypart}

    Cut points at arbitrary points can be introduced by introducing section-like
    commands in a manner similar to

         \NewSection\mysection{}
         \CutAt{mysection}


\Configure{+CutAt}.................................3

     #1 sectioning type
     #2 before
     #3 after

     Requests delimiters for the \CutAt buttons of the specified
     sectioning type

    Example:   \Configure{+CutAt}{mysection}{[}{]}

\PauseCutAt{#1}
\ContCutAt{#1}

    #1  section type

\Configure{CutAt-filename} ........................1

   A 2-parameter hook for tailoring section-based filenames.
   The section type is available through #1. The section title
   is accessible through #2.

   Example:   \Configure{CutAt-filename}{\NextFile{#1-#2.html}}


Tables of Contents
------------------

Created from the entries collected in the previous compilation within
a jobname.4tc file.

\ConfigureToc{unit-name} ......................4

   #1 before unit number
   #2 before content
   #3 before page number
   #4 at end

   * Empty arguments request the omission of the corresponding field.

   * \TocCount  Specifies the entry count withing the jobname.4tc file.

   * \TitleCount Count of entries submitted to the toc file

   * An alternative to \ConfigureToc{unit-name}:

      \def\toc<unit-name>#1#2#3{<before unit number>#1<before content>#2%
                             <before page number>#3<at end>}


   Example:

        \ConfigureToc{section}
           {}
           {\Picture[*]{pic.jpg width="13"  height="13"}~}
           {}
           {\HCode{<br />}}


\Configure{TocLink}..................4

   Configures the link offered in the third arguments of \ConfigureToc

   Example:   \Configure{TocLink}{\Link{#2}{#3}#4\EndLink}

\TocAt{#1,#2,#3,...}

    #1           section type for which local tables of contents
                 \Toc#1 are requested
    #2,#3,...    sectioning types to be included in the tables of
                 contents

    The non-leading arguments may be preceded by slashes '/', in
    which cases the arguments specify end points for the tables.

    The default setting requests automatic insertion of the local
    tables immediately after the sectioning heads.

    A star `*' character may be introduced, between the  \TocAt and
    the left brace, to request the appearances of the tables of
    contents at the end of the units' prefaces.

    A hyphen `-' character, on the other hand, disables the automatic
    insertions of the local tables.

    In case of a single argument, the command removes the
    existing definition of \Toc#1.

    Example:
      \TocAt{mychapter,mysection,mysubsection,/myappendix,/mypart}
      \TocAt-{mysection,mysubsection,/mylikesection}
      \section{...}...\Tocmysection

    The definition  of the local table of contents can be redefined
    within \csname Toc#1\endcsname.

    Example:

       \TocAt{section}
       \def\Tocsection{\TableOfContents[section]}

       \Css{div.sectionTOCS {
                           width : 30\%;
                           float : right;
                      text-align : left;
                  vertical-align : top;
                     margin-left : 1em;
                       font-size : 85\%;
                background-color : \#DDDDDD;
           }}

    Example: Table of content before the section title.

       \Configure{section}{}{}
          {\Tocsection \let\saveTocsection=\Tocsection
           \def\Tocsection{\let\Tocsection=\saveTocsection}%
           \ifvmode \IgnorePar\fi \EndP\IgnorePar
           \HCode{<h3 class="sectionHead">}\TitleMark\space\HtmlParOff}
          {\HCode{</h3>}\HtmlParOn\ShowPar \IgnoreIndent \par}

Cross-Linking
-------------

\Link[@1 @2]{@3}{@4}...\EndLink

  Creates

     <a href="@1#@3" name="@4" @2>...</a>

  * When @1 is empty, tex4ht will derive its value automatically.
    The derived value will be the file name containing the target @3.

  * \Link may be followed by `-', if tex4ht needs not automatically
    determine (for other \link commands) the file containing @4.
    In the present of such a flag, tex4ht can spare a definition of
    one macro.

  * The component [@1 @2] is optional. If omitted, @1 and @2 are
    assumed to be empty

  * The href attribute is omitted when @1 and @3 are empty

  * The name attribute is omitted when @4 is empty

  Examples:

      \Link{a}{}...\Endlink .....  \Link{}{b}...\EndLink
      \Link[http://foo  id="fooo"]{a}{b}...\EndLink

\Configure{Link}..............4

   Configures \Link...\EndLink so that

     #1 replaces `a'
     #2 replaces `href='
     #3 replaces `name='
     #4 replaces `#'.  If empty, the older value remains in effect.

  Examples:

   \Configure{Link}{a}{href=}{name=}{}
   \Configure{Link}{ref}{target=}{id=}{\empty}

\Configure{?Link}..............1

   #1 insertion before broken links

   To help with debugging

\LinkCommand...................1 <= i <= 6

   Creates a \Link-like command

   #1   tag name
   #2   href-like attribute
   #3   name-like attribute
   #4   insertion
   #5   /, if empty element
   #6  replacement for #  (ignored if absent)

  Example:

    \LinkCommand\JSLink{a,\noexpand\jsref,name}
    \def\jsref="#1"{href="javascript:window.open('#1')"}

    \JSLink{a}{}xx\EndJSLink
    \Link{}{a}\EndLink       % or \JSLink{}{a}\EndJSLink

\Configure{XrefFile}.....................1

   #1 names cross-references of files (appends #1 to `)F' and `)Q'
      entries of the .xref files). Applicable mainly implicitly
      within \Link commands

\Tag.....................................2

   #1  label
   #2  content

\Ref.....................................1
\LikeRef.................................1

   #1  label

   \Tag and \Ref are tex4ht.sty commands introduced cross-referencing
   content through .xref auxiliary files.

   \LikeRef is a variant of \Ref which doesn't verify whether the
   labels exit.  It is mainly used in \Link and \edef environments.

\ifTag ..................................3

   #1  quetioned tag
   #2  true part
   #3  false part

\LoadRef-[prefix]+{filename.ext}{pattern}

   Load the named xref-type file

   .xref      optional--`.xref' is assume for a default
   +          optional-- asks \Ref and \LikeRef commands
              to use expanded tags `filename::tag', instead of just `tag'
   [prefix]   optional--asks just for tags starting with the
              specified prefix.
   -          optional--deletes the prefixes from the loaded tags
   {pattern}  to be included only when `[prefix]' or `+' are included.
              States how tags are to be addressed, with the parameter
              symbol `#1'  specifying the loaded part.

   Example:

        % a.tex
        \LoadRef-[to:]{b}{from:#1}      \Ref{from:filename}
                                        \LikeRef{from:filename}

        % b.tex
        \Tag{to:filename}{\FileName}

   Example:

        \LoadRef-[)F]{file}{)Ffoo##1}
        \LoadRef-[)Q]{file}{)Qfoo##1}
        \Configure{XrefFile}{foo}   \Link...\EndLink

        \LoadRef{another-file}


Files
-----

\FileName    Holds the name of the current hypertext file
\FileNumber  Holds the internal number of the current hypertext file
\RefFileNumber...........................1
    #1  File number

    Provides the file name

\NextFile.................................1
    #1 Requested name for the next file

\Hinput{#1}

    The command asks to load the configuration files associated
    with mark #1.

\Hinclude[#1]{#2}

    The command associates configuration file #2 with mark #1.  If
    the mark is the star character `*', the configuration files is
    associated to all marks.  The command is applicable until the
    \Preamble command is processed

    For instance,  \Hinclude[*]{html4.4ht}....\Hinput{latex}

\Hinclude{#1}{#2}

    The command is applicable while the \Preamble command is
    processed. Its purpose is to load *4ht hook files within
    the fragments of code specified in #1.

    For instance, \Hinclude{\input plain.4ht}{plain}


Fonts
-----

\Configure{htf}...............................9

    #1         label (integer 0--255)
    #2         delimiter (a character not appearing in #3,...,#9)
           even label             odd label
    #3       start opening tag      start empty tag
    #4       name                   alt
    #5       size                   name
    #6       mag                    size
    #7                              mag
    #8       end the tag            ord
    #9       closing tag            end the tag

    The htf fonts assign a content and a label to each symbol (possibly
    followed by a comment).  For instance,

        'e'    '1'    epsilon
        'z'    '3'    zeta

    An even label asks that the content itself will be used for the
    symbol, and an odd label asks that the symbol will be represented by a
    bitmap.  In the later case,  the content serves as a substitution for
    browsers which don't exhibit bitmaps.

    The \Configure{htf}... command provides label-dependent wrappers to
    chosen representations.

    If they are not empty, `mag' and `ord' must be c-type
    patterns for integer arguments, and `name' and `size'
    should be a patterns for strings.  The `mag' entry is
    ignored for fonts of the default dimension. Together
    they specify a attribute-value format, mainly for references
    in the css code.

  Examples:

     \Configure{htf}{0}{+}{<span\Hnewline
        class="}{\%s}{-\%s}{x-x-\%d}{}{">}{</span>}
     \Configure{htf}{1}{+}{<img\Hnewline
        src="}{" alt="}{" class="}{\%s}{-\%d}{x-x-\%x}{" />}

\Configure{htf-attr}....................... 2

     #1  c-pattern for the font name and size
     #2  c-pattern for font magnification

     Specify the format of the selectors within the css files.

   Example:
     \Configure{htf-attr}{.\%s-%s}{--\%s}

\Configure{htf-css}....................... 2

    #1  font name or label
    #2  css entry

    A variant of the \Css command. If #1 is a font name,
    the contribution replaces the one given within the
    htf font definition. If #1 is a label for an entry
    of a htf font, the contribution is added to the css
    file.  The contribution is offered, only when the
    font is in use.

  Example:

   \Configure{htf-css}{4}{.small-caps{font-variant: small-caps;}}

\Configure{tableofcontents*}.......................1

    #1  A non-empty  parameter asks to implicitly introduce
        a \tableofcontents upon reaching the first sectioning
        command, if no \tableofcontents command is encountered
        earlier. The parameter assumes a colon-separated list
        of sectioning types to be included in the output
        of \tableofcontents.  Starred variants of sectioning
        types should be referenced with the `like' prefix.

        An empty parameter cancels earlier requests for implicit
        calls to \tableofcontents (e.g., embedded within requests
        to package options 1, 2, 3, 4)

   Example:

      \Configure{tableofcontents*}{part,likepart,%
           section,likesection,subsection,likesubsection}

\contentsname

   A LaTeX macro stating the title for a table of contents division.

          {\global\def\IndexSpace{class="indexspace"}}

       \Css{.indexspace{margin-top:1em;}}

    The links are indirectly requested in the idx files within
    \beforeentry macros. For instance, a file try.tex

       \documentclass{article}
          \makeindex
       \begin{document}

       \section{xx}

       \index{a1}  x

      makeindex -o try.ind try.4dx

    instead of

      makeindex -o try.ind try.idx

    should do the job.

    On some platforms, the quotation marks ' should be
    replaced by double quotation marks " or eliminated.

\Configure{makeindex} ..........................1

    The default setting, requests consecutive numbers for the

\Configure{tableofcontents*}.......................1

    #1  A non-empty  parameter asks to implicitly introduce
        a \tableofcontents upon reaching the first sectioning
        command, if no \tableofcontents command is encountered
        earlier. The parameter assumes a colon-separated list
        of sectioning types to be included in the output
        of \tableofcontents.  Starred variants of sectioning
        types should be referenced with the `like' prefix.

        An empty parameter cancels earlier requests for implicit
        calls to \tableofcontents (e.g., embedded within requests
        to package options 1, 2, 3, 4)

   Example:

      \Configure{tableofcontents*}{part,likepart,%
           section,likesection,subsection,likesubsection}

\contentsname

   A LaTeX macro stating the title for a table of contents division.

\Configure{tableofcontents*}.......................1

    #1  A non-empty  parameter asks to implicitly introduce
        a \tableofcontents upon reaching the first sectioning
        command, if no \tableofcontents command is encountered
        earlier. The parameter assumes a colon-separated list
        of sectioning types to be included in the output
        of \tableofcontents.  Starred variants of sectioning
        types should be referenced with the `like' prefix.

        An empty parameter cancels earlier requests for implicit
        calls to \tableofcontents (e.g., embedded within requests
        to package options 1, 2, 3, 4)

   Example:

      \Configure{tableofcontents*}{part,likepart,%
           section,likesection,subsection,likesubsection}

\contentsname

   A LaTeX macro stating the title for a table of contents division.

Frames
------

When the package option `frames-' or `frames' is up,
TeX4ht introduces the following commands for defining frames.

   \Frame[#1]{#2}

       A variant of the \Link[#1]{#2} portion of the
       \Link[#1]{#2}{#3}#4\EndLink, for specifying a frame.

   \HorFrames[#1]{#2}, \VerFrames[#1]{#2}

     #1 attributes  ([#1] is optional)
     #2 list of dimensions

      A container partitioned, respectively, horizontally or
      vertically. Each partition may hold a sub-container or
      a frame.

      The list of dimensions determine the cardinality of the
      partition, and the dimension of each partition.  A dimension
      can be specified absolutely by pixels (\HorFrames{80,130,50}),
      relatively by percentage (\HorFrames{20\%,30\%,50\%}), and
      relatively through ratio (\HorFrames{2*,3*,5*}).

   \EndFrames

      An end delimiter for a container

   \NoFrames

       When used, it should be placed before the outer-most
       \EndFrames command.  The region \NoFrames...\EndNoFrames
       provides the content for browsers which do not support frames.

Tailoring configurations for frames is a little tricky, but the
job is simpler when the configurations don't deal with the root
file.

Example 1:

The arguments`init-body' and `init-toc' are labels connecting reference points
\Frame[...]{label} with anchors \Link{}{label}\EndLink.  Their objective
is to associate initial web pages with the frames.

The name attribute values `body' and `menu' provide
identifiers to the frames.  They offer the option to dynamically load
new pages into the frames through hypertext references targeting those
values.
