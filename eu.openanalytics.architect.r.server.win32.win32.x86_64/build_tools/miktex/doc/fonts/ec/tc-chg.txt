            Added tcfs (Fibonacci Slanted) as suggeseted by Ulrik Vieth

            Finally found the bug in upwards and downwards arrows, causing

            switched.

23-DEC-1996 Made all fontnames 4 letters + 4 digits for the interpolating
            fonts. Renamed tcr -> tcrm, tcb -> tcrb, tcu -> tcui.

22-DEC-1996 Got rid of txmacros.mf by moving the few definitions either
            to exbase.mf or txaccent.mf.
            Consequently applied |hi.| in txpseudo.mf.
 
20-DEC-1996 Starting transition to ec: Renamed files, replaced |dcchar| by
            |ecchar|, changed file headers, changed |version_check| to ask
            for (1,0).

            servicemark, abzueglich

18-NOV-1996 Added more characters: textminus, ascender height cwm,
            copyleft, circled P, new tie, capital new tie,
            numero sign, aestimated sign, quill brackets,
            reference mark, textsurd, open bullet

18-NOV-1996 Applied the changes in dcbi parameters also to 
            tcbi

*********** Release of dc 1.3 Patchlevel 3 *************************************

23-AUG-1996 Changed Parameters for tcsx at 5 pt.

23-AUG-1996 Added |zero_width| to the programme for the capital compound word
            mark; without this statement the chardx value is wrong.

*********** Release of dc 1.3 **************************************************

31-MAY-1996 Corrected |tiny| for dcsx..tcso at 5 pt
            Changed |clear_memory| to |clear_extra_memory|

            by Ulrik Vieth)

            Added the additional font dimensions 23--31
            Removed unneeded |lc_circle_height(#)|

24-APR-1996 Changed the |basedef|-line for tcbi to contain unrounded
            sizes (14.4 instead of 14 etc.)
            Buildt in version consistency control
            Added comma and full stop to the tc character set,
            this facilates macros for oldstyle digits.

            consequences
