dc-chg.txt

This file documents the changes on the dc-fonts since version 1.1. Most 
recent changes are on top of this file.

 1-FEB-1997 After the release of the ec fonts, this file is closed.
            Further changes will be documented in ec-chg.txt.

19-JAN-1997 Fought again with the |uc_hachek_accent| since it came out too
            high (with white space above) in the metrics. Eliminated
            |uc_acc_height#| from exrueast.mf and the driver files.
            Fixed a bug in the single base quote (reported by Bernd Raichle)
            Added anti-kernings to separate ```triple''' and 
            ````quadruple'''' quotes nicely
            ectc: Call exmligtb for monospace ligatures
            Did some finish to the ligtables (this is the last chance, in
            fact, since changing the ligtables changes the metrics).

 7-JAN-1997 Added ecfs (Fibonacci Slanted) as suggested by Ulrik Vieth
            Changed |vair| for ecso from 13 to 15 (found by Ulrik Vieth)
            Corrected Batch file generation in ecstdedt.tex
            Deleted dxbase.ini_mf (suggested by Ulrik Vieth)

23-DEC-1996 Made all fontnames 4 letters + 4 digits for the interpolating
            fonts. Renamed ecr -> ecrm, ecb -> ecrb, ecu -> ecui.

22-DEC-1996 Accents for small capital letters are now ``small capital 
            accents''. Moved information from exaccess to exbase.
            Made capital tilde accent 9u# wide. Reincluded 
            |center_on| in exbase. Deleted all references to dcbase.
            Consequently applied |hi.| in expseudo.mf. Improved the
            |uc_hachek_accent| on small caps.
            Added typewriter fonts (both visible and invisible) for
            documentclass slides (former SliTeX), named [i]ecltt8.
            ecltt8 is unfortunately different from ectt0800, because the
            interpolation routines introduce some rounding errors on
            the base points.

21-DEC-1996 Deleted boolean variable |acute_sharp| from exbase, because
            it was never used. Added switch |fancy_thorn| to choose
            different thorn shapes.

20-DEC-1996 Starting transition to ec: Renamed files, replaced
            |dcchar| by |ecchar|, renamed |font_identifier|, changed
            file headers, changed |version_check| to ask for (1,0).

19-NOV-1996 Removed |big_...|-macros from dxbase. Added macro
            |super_crescent| used in the Servicemark sign.

18-NOV-1996 Adjusted parameters in dcbi (there was an awful bug
            in |jut| causing no error messages but damaged
            glyphs with dcbi0500)

18-NOV-1996 Added more ligtable entries: Kv (Kvarner) Kw (Kwik),
            V against consonants (russian transliteration)

 4-NOV-1996 Adjusted the position of the circumflex in \^a. Also made 
            all lowercase circumflexes overshoot a little (oo).

*********** Release of dc 1.3 Patchlevel 4 *************************************

25-AUG-1996 Aplied the parameter change also to dcso at 5 pt

23-AUG-1996 Changed Parameters for dcsx at 5 pt, adjusted
            |lc_hachek_accent|

23-AUG-1996 Added |zero_width| to the programme for the compound word
            mark; without this statement the chardx value is wrong.

*********** Release of dc 1.3 Patchlevel 2 *************************************

 3-JUL-1996 Added macro |clear_mode_guards|. This change makes modes like
            |nechi| as defined in modes.mf 3.0 work.
            Added missing |;| in the checking section
            Corrected wording of one error message, hopefully
            never to be seen by an end user.
            All changes suggested by Andreas Schwab

            Added file 00bugs.txt with known bugs.

            Gave the cwm |x_height#|

            Andreas Schwab)
           
24-APR-1996 Added |lower.dot_size#| to dctc.mf, removed
            |lower.uu#| from the same file.

            Took provision for modes.mf in dxbase.mf
            After some solid hacking the fonts compile again
            Gone through the easern and western european letters,
            did some clean up (character names, placement of \~N).

14-APR-1996 Buildt in changes from plfonts 1.07 to fix resolution-
            dependent metrics. This affects the following characters
            and macros:
            dxpunct.mf: French opening and closing quotes

            dxrllett.mf, letter m:
             lft x1l=hround(2.5u-.5stem); x1l=x1'l=x2l=x2'l; % stem, sic
             lft x3l=hround(.5w-.5mfudged.stem); x5-x3=x3-x1;
             if not monospace: r:=hround(x5+x1)+r-w; fi

            Did the same to \l, \'l and \v l in dxleast.mf
            Marked Fixed and partially fixed bugs in 00bugs.txt

            $:=3; fi endfor| in dxbase from cmbase.
            Did some finish: file headers, documentation files,
            deletion of old files

28-AUG-1995 Added kerning Wn and Vn (polish/russian proper names)
            Kern italic "W" like "V" instead of "T"

            Added boolean parameter |one_serif| to control base
            serif on digit `1'
            Added parameters for dcfb0500 (Fibonacci font), corrected
            basesizes to be Fibonacci numbers.
            |notch_cut#| and |cap_notch_cut#| are measured in |pt#|, not
            in |1/36pt#|. Corrected in several parameter files.
            Tuned again the sans parameters, this time for small sizes;
            dcsx0500 works now, but it is more condensed than dcss0500

17-AUG-1995 Changed positions 6, 7, and 6' of capital R from |vair| to
            |.5[vair,cap_band]|, because |vair| looks too thin at 99.99pt
            Undid the previous change again, since it causes more trouble 
            at low sizes than it saves a really large ones.
            Changed |math_spread| in cmr to [-.2] for 17.28pt
            Did the same for dcsl, dcss, and dcsi
            Completely retuned the parameters for sans serif fonts.
            dcsx is now always bolder then dcss, dcss much brighter
            then in release 1.1
            Tuned height of acute accent again.

            Added kerning for kV, kW, mV, mW, eV, Vv (Vvedensky)
            Added kerning for \'n, \v{n}, \eng, and \~n
            Added kerning for ,,j, ,,g, and ,,y
            Added kerning between boundarychar and quotes
            Defined |lig_O_table| and |lig_C_table|
            Added kerning between Av and Aw
            Added some special kerning for \l and \k{a}
            Added `, ``, and '' to the characters with special kerning 
            after f and ff
            Corrected bugs in |lig_a_table| and |lig_o_table| for roman
            fonts
            Added kernings for boundarychar and quotes for italic fonts

            Corrected height of uppercase hachek for sans serif case
            Changed definition of uc_acc_height#
            dxcsc now recalculates the pseudoparameters for the lowercase
            settings, this fixes a problem with \sc{\^o}
            Moved acute on `i' a little to the left

11-JUL-1995 Deleted macro |pi_stroke| from dxbase
            Renamed second argument of the circle accent macros to
            |y_bottom| (was |y_center| bzw. |y_move|, which gives a
            wrong impression of its function)
            Deleted pens and macros needed for calligraphic letters only
            from dxbase
            Replaced the original cm accents in dxaccent.mf with the
            lowercase version used in the precomposed letters

            Adjusted height of a and g with breve
            Removed no longer needed accent macros from dxbase
            Adjusted height of accent macros in dxbase 
            Introduced |accent_gap| into dxbase, it is a little dirty 
            at the moment, but I can be sure that it is known when needed (jk)

10-JUL-1995 Minor fix to |put_dot| in dxaccess

 3-JUL-1995 Corrected fudge in dcss.mf (the value for 17.28 is changed
            from 1 to 0.965). This gives good results upto 99.99 pt
            (Problem reported by Klaus Barthelmann, Mainz).
            There is another problem with the parameters left,
            causing the `=' sign to collapse at large sizes, ditto
            with `#', `>', and `<'.  (jk)

19-JUN-1995 Corrected height of S with cedilla
            Finally got the hachek on typewriter capitals looking okay
                       
18-JUN-1995 Made provision for tc blank symbol in dxaccess.mf 
            Added humanist design for blank space in serifed fonts

            boxen (dxpunct.mf)
            Corrected boundary box of german opening quotes (dxpunct.mf) (jk)

29-MAY-1995 Included fine tuning from polkap.mf (plfonts: driver for
            caps'n'small caps) into dxcsc.mf
            Replaced capital Eng with the one from the fc fonts and

            Changed the Hungarian long umlaut to be consistent with
            the new acute accent (jk)

 7-MAY-1995 Replaced all settings of dot_diam# and dot_diam in the dc
            fonts by pseudoparameters.
            Removed all initialisations of heavy_hair
            Introduced pseudoparameter lc_trema_height# from csfonts
            Introduced boolean variable slitex (controls serifs on 
            capital I)
