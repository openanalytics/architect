      European Computer Modern Fonts and Text Companion Fonts

This is the first stable release of the European Computer Modern fonts.
They are intended to be as stable as the Computer Modern fonts from D. 
Knuth are. This means, that there will be no changes to the following 
features of the ec fonts:

* There will be no changes to the font encoding 

* There will be no changes to the font metrics

* The macros from exbase will not be removed, nor will their
  arguments change meaning, even if they are by chance unused in the ec 
  fonts.

For the tc fonts, the following features remain stable:

* No characters will be removed from the tc fonts, nor will their
  codepoints change

* The metrics of the established symbols will not be changed.

Note, that future releases of the tc fonts may contain more characters, 
which will lead to different tfm files and checksum errors. However, those 
errors can safely be ignored because the extensions will not spoil 
backwards compatibility.

The documentation is currently provisorial and I want to replace it 
when I find the time to complete the real documentation of the ec fonts.

Please read the copying conditions as given in the file copyrite.txt.
