Change History
--------------
2021-01-08 luaotfload v3.17

    *  The fontloader has been synced with the context code from 2021-01-07.
       This improves support for advanced CFF based OpenType variable fonts.

2020-12-31 luaotfload v3.16

    *  The fontloader has been synced with the context code from 2020-12-30
    *  The entry point is called luaotfload.lua instead of
       luaotfload-main.lua (but the old name is still provided for 
       compatibility).
    *  pre/post_shaping_filter callbacks has been added.
    *  The number of lua-files and submodules shown in the log-file 
       has been reduced. But it is extended again by setting the environment 
       variable LUAOTFLOAD_TRACE_SUBMODULES=1.
    *  The HarfBuzz based shaper will in some situations drop hyphenation
       points. This happens less frequently now since the new version uses
       first/second discretionaries (the mechanism described in the LuaTeX manual,
       section 5.6 for the of-f-ice example) to support a limited amount of
       nesting.
    *  When the node shaper is used, experimental support for 
       OpenType variable fonts has been added. To use them, set the font 
       feature axis to a comma separated list of axis names and values. 
       (E.g.  axis={weight=600}) The supported axis names and value 
       range depend on the font.
    *  The font features upper and lower can be used to map
       the text of a font to upper or lowercase before displaying it. Currently
       this implements the untailored Unicode case mapping algorithm, but it is
       planned to add tailoring later.
    *  A number of small bugfixes.

2020-09-02 luaotfload v3.15
    * The font database is updated more reliably if fonts get deleted.
    * In multiple error cases, error messages are shown instead of silently
      generating bad output.
    * Write glyph ids instead of internal identifiers to DVI files. This
      allows using OpenType fonts when working with dvilualatex.
      (This requires additional support from the DVI reader)
    * The set of font features which are enabled by default has been 
      changed to be more similar to HarfBuzz.
      Especially Above-base mark Positioning (abvm),
      Below-base mark Positioning (blwm), Contextual
      Alternates (calt), Cursive Positioning (curs),
      Distances (dist), and Required Contextual Alternates
     (rclt) are now enabled by default for all scripts.
    * Added a mathfontdimen font feature which allows emulating
      fontdimen values from xetex or traditional \TeX\ math fonts.
    * Initial support for variable fonts in node mode.


2020-05-01 luaotfload v3.14
    * bug fix for luaotfload-tool, luaotfload-tool --list=basename failed (texlive list)
    * fontloader patched to resolve issue #124
    
2020-05-01 luaotfload v3.13
    * A problem with text fonts with minimal math table has been fixed (issue 148.)
      In new luaotfload versions, math parameters will only be loaded for fonts with `script=math`.
      If you do want to set math parameters for fonts with other scripts, add `-nomathparam`.
      We strongly recommend against setting math parameters for text fonts because
      these would overwrite parameters from actual math fonts.
    * A bug in harf-mode that could lead to missing chars and freezing was corrected (issue 141).
    * A font size problem in harf-mode has been fixed (issue 147).
    * An error if the main function was called twice has been fixed (issue 145).
    * Allow .ttf fonts to be loaded with a map file with luahbtex (issue 142) (issue 143).
    * Fonts installed for a single user on windows are now found (issue 138).
    * A problem with wrong \TeX-ligatures in harf mode has been fixed (issue 139).
    * The debugging output has been changed (issue 131).
    * a missing U+1E9E (Capital ÃŸ) in a font is replaced by 
      SS instead of giving a missing character.
    * extended the color handling to be compatible with the luacolor package  
    * sync with context files from 2020-04-30
    
2020-02-02 luaotfload v3.12
    * new experimental feature multiscript
    * new experimental feature fallback
    * extension of the color feature to color output glyphs 
    * Small bug correction
    
2019-11-10 luaotfload v3.11
    * Changed the handling of the script key in harf mode to be more compatible with behaviour of the node mode. 
      It now expects the name of a script that is actually in the font instead of a ISO 15924 script tag. See issue 117.
    * Corrected a number of small typos and bugs in harf mode.

2019-11-04 luaotfload v3.1
    * added code to use the harfbuzz library of luahbtex ("mode=harf")

    * fix luaotfload-tool support of ttc fonts (PR#58)
    * sync with context files from 2019-05-18 (improves handling of large fonts, see e.g. issue #55 and PR#58)

    * rename ``luaotfload-merged.lua`` (the fontloader package from Context)
      to ``luaotfload-fontloader.lua``
    * Treat arguments of the ``letterspace`` option as percentages; add
      ``kernfactor`` option that behaves as before.

      letterspacing is now the canonical method.
    * Merge functionality from extralibs (fake Context layer) into

2013/05/20, luaotfload v2.2:
    * There is now a central, non-personal dev repo on github:
      https://github.com/lualatex/luaotfload
    * Synchronisation with ConTeXt from TeXLive 2013, inducing
      backward-incompatible changes in the font structure. A
      backward-compatibility layer has been added for the current
      versions of fontspec, unicode-math and microtype, but it should
      disapear in a future version.
    * Synchronisation with ConTeXt is now easier and can be done by just
      updating luaotfload-merged.lua (<= luatex-fonts-merged.lua from
      the LuaTeX-Plain format)
    * Improved and extended documentation
    * Font filenames are stored in the database (file: lookups more efficient)
    * Optional caching of name: lookups (uses separate cache file)
    * Rewriting and increased fidelity of XeTeX emulation
    * Renaming mkluatexfontdb into luaotfload-tool (the old behavior is kept if
      the script is symlinked or renamed mkluatexfontdb)
    * Added options to luaotfload-tool for simple database queries
    * Logging facilities have been rewritten and allow for more granularity
    * All files have been renamed, abandoning cryptic acronyms; also
      the new prefix is "luaotfload" (<= "otfl")
    * The Adobe Glyph List (font-age.lua) is now built via script (mkglyphlist)
    * Hans adapted the font loader to several of our requests (attribute
      allocation, custom merged package name etc.)
    * Auxiliary functions for package authors
    * Man page for luaotfload-tool
    * Unsupported v1.3 codebase is included in the luaotfload-*lua files. Crude,
      but effective way to support older Luatex binaries
    * implemented basic cache control/stats option for luaotfload-tool
    * Character list is generated from char-def.lua (mkcharacters)

    *  fixing font cache file name with non-ascii characters

2013/04/25, luaotfload v1.29:
    * Reverting the unified resolver, as the database was rebuilt too often
