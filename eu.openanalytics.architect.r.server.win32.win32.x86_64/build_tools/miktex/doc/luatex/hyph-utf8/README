                    The luatex hyphenation package.

This package provides functions to be used for hyphenation pattern loading
in LuaTeX. The patterns are loaded at runtime and not in the format.
This leads to much shorter format loading time, with no loss as the 
patterns are not really loaded in the format, just copied and then loaded
at runtime.

This package is developped on <http://tug.org/svn/texhyphen/trunk/hyph-utf8/>.

Installation
------------

These files are part of the format, so they should be installed in your
