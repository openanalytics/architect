		Arabi System 
		Version 1.1
		(c) Youssef Jabri


An author maintained LPPL system to write in Arabic and Farsi. 
Fully compatible with BABEL and can use commercial fonts 
(as well as free ones :)

See the PDF user guide in the documentation folder texmf/doc/arabi 
concerning how to use the system!


Among the new things with Version 1.1:
==========================
+ You can search and copy Arabic and Farsi text from PDF files generated by pdflatex (read the documentation to know how to)
+ You can use TeX4ht to make HTML files.
+ Now we can have Arabic in the bookmarks sidebar, although hyperref is still not fully supported yet.
+ In Farsi contexts, Digits (0, 1, . . . , 9) are written with the extended Indo-Arabic (Farsi) digits.
+ Changed some control sequences to more standard forms and less problematic ones, (request made during TUG 2006)
\R --> \textRL
\L --> \textLR (\L is used by the Polish languagae)
\embox  --> \LRmbox
\ambox  --> \ARmbox
\fmbox  --> \FRmbox
+ Only the following Farsi fonts from the Farsiweb project are Free (GPL): 
(Nazli, Nazli bold, Homa, Titr). The others should be GPL'ed in their next release. Thank you R. Pournader. 
I modified the free fonts Notices to say they are GPL, as suggested by Pournader, and removed
the non free ones from Arabi.

Last minute addenum:
====================
To get your system to know about the Type 1 (.pfb) files that come 
with "Arabi":

in principle, 

1) a line like: 
+p arabi.map
should be added to the file "config.ps" in the "/usr/share/texmf/dvips/config"  folder.
But since this file is updated automatically, all information that is added manually
is (will be) overwritten and lost!

2) or u should call dvips with the option -u "dvips arabi.map"

3) There's also "dvips -P arabi " where "config.arabi" contains at least 
the line "p +arabi.map". 

4) The best way:
You should know how to use the "updmap" utility that comes
with your specific Installation.

Concerning MikTeX:
==================
Arabi is a part of MikTeX 2.5, so just call the package manager and get it to install Arabi for you.
If you still use an earlier version, just download Arabi, unzip it where due and:
1. create an empty configuration file "updmap.cfg" in the local config
   directory, e.g.
      C:\localtexmf\miktex\config\updmap.cfg
(For your information, a file "updmap.cfg" comes in /texmf/web2c/
YOU SHOULD NOT MODIFY IT, because this file can be
overwritten by the MiKTeX Update Wizard.)

2. start editing the file:
    e.g.: notepad C:\localtexmf\miktex\config\updmap.cfg
     
3. add the following configuration settings, 

# arabi
Map arabi.map

then save the file

4. update the file name database:
     initexmf -u
     
5. create the font map files:
     initexmf --mkmaps
     
Settings specified in the local configuration file take precedence
over those specified in the main configuration file 
(i.e. /texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg).
