## Babel 3.53

This package manages culturally-determined typographical (and other)
rules, and hyphenation patterns for a wide range of languages.  Many
language styles work with pdflatex, as well as with xelatex and
lualatex out of the box.  A few even work with plain formats.

The latest stable version is available on <https://ctan.org/pkg/babel>.

Changes in version 3.53 are described in:

https://github.com/latex3/babel/wiki/What's-new-in-babel-3.53

Included is a set of ini files for about 250 languages. 

The best way to install and/or update it is with the help of package
managers.

3.47   2020-07-13
       * Fixes:
         - Spurious spaces when autoloading locales (bug introduced
           in 3.46 when fixing #80).
         - In dtx files, autoloading printed some spurious text
           (because % is set to ignore, #87).
       * New - \getlocaleproperty*, which doesn't raise an error.
       * Basic ini+tex templates for about 500 languages in the GitHub
         repository.
https://github.com/latex3/babel/wiki/What's-new-in-babel-3.47

3.46   2020-07-06
       * Languages can now be optionally selected with their BCP 47
         tags.
       * \BabelEnsureInfo now loads the basic data for the requested
         languages immediately (formerly it was done at the end of the
         preamble).
       * Fixes:
         - Getting rid of the hyphen in XeTeX was not working as
           expected. A new procedure has been devised.
         - tag.bcp47 now contains what its name promises, instead of
           just the language subtag (#70).
         - Locale info was not loaded if the name had uppercase letters
           in some OSs (#80).
         - The [..|..] syntax in ini dates didn't recognize 'digits'.

       * Improvements in Kurdish, Marathi.
       * Alternative date formats with \localedate[calendar=...,
         variant=...]{y}{m}{d} (note: no calendar computations, just
         strings).
       * \today is (again) case-aware.
       * \localenumeral{digits}{..} and \localecounter{digits}{cntr}
         for native digits.
       * Fixes
         - Improved handling of math with \babelposthyphenation and
           \babelprehyphenation (it was ignoring too much).
         - An error related to \bbl@foreign@x could be raised in some
           rare cases.
