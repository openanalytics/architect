The ENVIRON package
v0.2

Provides two things: a new way of defining
environments that read their contents before
processing; and, a \long version of amsmath's
\collect@body macro called \Collect@Body.

Here's an example:

  \NewEnviron{test}[3][]{"#1,#2,\BODY,#3"}
  \begin{test}[zero]{one}{last}
    three\par four
  \end{test}

Produces the equivalent of:

  "zero,one,three\par four,last"
