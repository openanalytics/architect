LaTeX support for color and graphics
====================================

Release 2020-10-05

This bundle contains the 'engine-dependent' part of support for
color and graphics in LaTeX2e (the code here will also function
with plain TeX). These `.def` files work with the color/graphics
core in `latex/required/graphics`.

The code here was originally contributed by multiple authors.
The bundle is now maintained by the LaTeX3 Project.

Released under the LPPL, version 1.3c or later.
