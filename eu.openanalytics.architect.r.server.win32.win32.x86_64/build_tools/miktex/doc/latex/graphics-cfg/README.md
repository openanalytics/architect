Sample configuration files for LaTeX2e color and graphics

Note that these files are, as far as possible, in the public domain
and may be edited to suit the distribution being used.

Specifically they are released under the CC0 1.0 Universal licence
 https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/


They may be edited by end users, but more commonly should be edited
by maintainers of TeX distributions to detect a suitable range of
package options for the tex systems and dvi drivers available.


These color and graphics configurations will make the color and
graphics packages default option be
luatex, pdftex, vtex, xetex or dvips.
Note that pdftex option is used for luatex versions older than
luatex 0.87.



These files are currently maintained by the LaTeX3 project but
incorporating work by Thomas Esser, Heiko Oberdiek, Sebastian Rahtz,
Karl Berry and others.
