This file contains a brief description of the Greek hyphenation-
pattern files for TeX/LaTeX (and for Omega) prepared by Dimitrios 
Filippou. 

The patterns were originally designed for the "greek" option of 
"babel" and Dryllerakis' GreeKTeX package.  However, this set can 
be used to produce hyphenation patterns for typesetting Greek with
the "ibycus" option of "babel" (package "ibycus-babel") or with 
Omega/lambda (package "antomega").

The hyphenation patterns for "ibycus" (for ancient Greek *only*) 
can be produced by running a perl script on "grahyph.tex".  The 
perl script has been written by Peter Heslin (p.j.heslin@dur.ac.uk) 
as part of his "ibycus-babel" package.

The hyphenation patterns for Omega/lambda (files "ogr*.tex") can be 
produced by running a perl script on "grahyph.tex", "grahyph.tex" 
and "grahyph.tex".  The perl script has been written by Apostolos 
Syropoulos (apostolo@obelix.ee.duth.gr) as part of the "antomega" 
package.  THESE PATTERNS HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED.  ANY FEEDBACK IS
WELCOME!

This package supersedes all previous versions found in CTAN.  A more
detailed description of how hyphenation of Greek works (in English)
is presented in the TUG2004 conference and is included in the 
conference proceedings (to be published by Springer in the series
Lecture Notes in Computer Science).

Possible caveats: 

1) You may not get proper hyphenation in paragraphs with mixed 
Greek and non-Greek text.  This is a known TeX problem.  Using eTeX 
(or the latest LaTeX releases which are based on eTeX) can resolve
this problem. -- Bug reported by Peter Heslin (p.j.heslin@dur.ac.uk)

2) Initial accentuated vowels may not be hyphenated under Omega/
lambda: e.g., under Omega/lambda, the word ">aet'oc" (eagle) may be
be hyphenated as ">ae-t'oc" instead of ">a-e-t'oc".  To fix this 
problem I must add an extra series of hyphenation patterns in the
original "gr?hyph.tex" and then convert them to "ogr?hyph.tex".  But
this way I would mess my original "gr?hyph.tex" and I don't want to
do that. -- Bug reported by Alexej Krioukov (akrioukov@newmail.ru)

2008-July-24  JH:  Replaced GRAhyph4.tex, GRMhyph4.tex, and GRPhype4.tex
  with corresponding gr?hyph5.tex.  It is needed for 8-bit engines by new 
  pattern loaders hyph-utf8.
