Ukrhyph package.

This package contains hyphenation patterns for Ukrainian.

To install, copy all files to your texmf tree. For example,
create a directory $TEXMF/tex/generic/ukrhyph/ and put all
files there.

You can select your favourite pattern by editing `ukrhyph.tex'. 
Required encoding could be selected either by by editing `ukrhyph.tex' 
or by using file ukrhyph.<ENC> where <ENC> is output encoding.

Ukrainian hyphenation could be added to LaTeX by creation `hyphen.cfg'
file containing e.g. the following lines:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
\language=0 % English
\lefthyphenmin=2 \righthyphenmin=3 % disallow x- or -xx breaks
\input hyphen
\language=1 % Ukrainian
\lefthyphenmin=2 \righthyphenmin=2 % disallow x- or -x breaks; -xx OK
\input ukrhyph.t2a
% Or \input ukrhyph.lcy
% Or \input ukrhyph.ot2
\def\English{\language0 }
\def\Ukrainian{\language1 }
\language=0 % English
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you use Babel, you can modify `language.dat':

----------------------------------------------------------------------
% File    : language.dat
% Purpose : tell iniTeX what files with patterns to load.
english    hyphen.tex
% you can uncomment what encoding do you need
ukrainian     ukrhyph.t2a
%ukrainian     ukrhyph.lcy
%ukrainian     ukrhyph.ot2
