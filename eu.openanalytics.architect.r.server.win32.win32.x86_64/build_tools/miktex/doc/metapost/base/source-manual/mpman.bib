  abstract =     "This paper presents a multiple-precision binary floating-point library,
                 written in the ISO C language, and based on the GNU MP library. Its
                 particularity is to extend to arbitrary-precision ideas from the IEEE 754
                 standard, by providing \emph{correct rounding} and \emph{exceptions}.
                 We demonstrate how these strong semantics are achieved --- with no
                 significant slowdown with respect to other arbitrary-precision tools
                 --- and discuss a few applications where such a library can be useful.",
