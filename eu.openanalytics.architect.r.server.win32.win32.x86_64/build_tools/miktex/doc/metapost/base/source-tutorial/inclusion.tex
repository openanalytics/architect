\section{Including \MP{} figures in \LaTeX}
\label{sec:latexincl}

In order to include a \MP{} figure in \LaTeX{}, the \File{graphicx}
package is suggested.  Below is an example of including a \MP{} figure
(with name \File{foo-1.mps}) in a \LaTeX{} document.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=LaTeX]
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
|\dots|
\includegraphics{foo-1.mps}
|\dots|
\end{document}
\end{lstlisting}

Having a \File{.mps} file extension on the graphic allows the same
graphic to be included in both \LaTeX{} and \PDF\LaTeX{} documents.
When using \PDF\LaTeX, the EPS graphic (with file extension \File{.mps})
is converted to \PDF{} ``on the fly'' using Hans Hagen's \File{mptopdf}.
This conversion is necessary since \PDF\LaTeX{} performs no \PS{}
processing.
