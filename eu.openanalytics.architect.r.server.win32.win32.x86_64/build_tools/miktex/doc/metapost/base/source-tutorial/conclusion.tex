\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\MP{} is an elegant programming language, and it produces beautiful
graphics.  The graphics are vectorial and thus can be scaled to any
resolution without degradation.  There are many advanced topics that are
not discussed in this article (e.g., loops, flow control, subpaths,
intersections, etc.), and the \MP{} manual~\cite{hobby:user} is an
excellent resource for these advanced topics.  However, the \MP{} manual
may seem daunting for beginners.  There are many websites containing
\MP{} examples, and several of these are referenced at
\url{http://www.tug.org/metapost}.  Finally, we mention that Knuth uses
nothing but \MP{} for his diagrams.
