\section{Common commands}
\label{sec:commoncmds}

The \MP{} manual~\cite{hobby:user} lists 26 built-in commands along with
23 function-like macros for which pictures can be drawn and manipulated
using \MP.  We will not discuss each of these commands here; however, we
will focus on several of the most common commands and provide examples
of their usage.

\input{draw}
\input{fill}
\input{arrows}
\input{label}
