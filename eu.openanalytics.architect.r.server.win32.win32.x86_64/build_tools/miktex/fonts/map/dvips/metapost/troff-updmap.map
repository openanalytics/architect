% This map file is the TeX Live counterpart to troff.map, removing all
% the entries for the PostScript base35 fonts (leaving just the sngle
% FreeEuro entry).  Why?  Because we want the *8g.tfm names to obey the
% same updmap options for downloading/not-downloading as the 8r, 8y,
% etc., versions.  Therefore they have to be handled from the same
% source map files (in TL's texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/tetex).
