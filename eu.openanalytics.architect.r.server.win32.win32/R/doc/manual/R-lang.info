1 Introduction
**************

R is a system for statistical computation and graphics. It provides,
among other things, a programming language, high level graphics,
interfaces to other languages and debugging facilities.  This manual
details and defines the R language.

   The R language is a dialect of S which was designed in the 1980s and
has been in widespread use in the statistical community since.  Its
principal designer, John M. Chambers, was awarded the 1998 ACM Software
Systems Award for S.

   The language syntax has a superficial similarity with C, but the
semantics are of the FPL (functional programming language) variety with
stronger affinities with Lisp and APL.  In particular, it allows
"computing on the language", which in turn makes it possible to write
functions that take expressions as input, something that is often
useful for statistical modeling and graphics.

   It is possible to get quite far using R interactively, executing simple
expressions from the command line.  Some users may never need to go
beyond that level, others will want to write their own functions either
in an ad hoc fashion to systematize repetitive work or with the
perspective of writing add-on packages for new functionality.

   The purpose of this manual is to document the language _per se_.
That is, the objects that it works on, and the details of the expression
evaluation process, which are useful to know when programming R
functions.  Major subsystems for specific tasks, such as graphics, are
only briefly described in this manual and will be documented separately.

   Although much of the text will equally apply to S, there are also
some substantial differences, and in order not to confuse the issue we
shall concentrate on describing R.

   The design of the language contains a number of fine points and
common pitfalls which may surprise the user.  Most of these are due to
consistency considerations at a deeper level, as we shall explain.
There are also a number of useful shortcuts and idioms, which allow the
user to express quite complicated operations succinctly.  Many of these
become natural once one is familiar with the underlying concepts.  In
some cases, there are multiple ways of performing a task, but some of
the techniques will rely on the language implementation, and others work
at a higher level of abstraction.  In such cases we shall indicate the
preferred usage.

   Some familiarity with R is assumed.  This is not an introduction to
R but rather a programmers' reference manual.  Other manuals provide
complementary information: in particular *note Preface:
(R-intro)Preface. provides an introduction to R and *note System and
foreign language interfaces: (R-exts)System and foreign language
interfaces. details how to extend R using compiled code.

2 Objects
*********

In every computer language variables provide a means of accessing the
data stored in memory.  R does not provide direct access to the
computer's memory but rather provides a number of specialized data
structures we will refer to as objects.  These objects are referred to
through symbols or variables.  In R, however, the symbols are
themselves objects and can be manipulated in the same way as any other
object.  This is different from many other languages and has wide
ranging effects.

   In this chapter we provide preliminary descriptions of the various
data structures provided in R.  More detailed discussions of many of
them will be found in the subsequent chapters.  The R specific function
`typeof' returns the "type" of an R object.  Note that in the C code
underlying R, all objects are pointers to a structure with typedef
`SEXPREC'; the different R data types are represented in C by
`SEXPTYPE', which determines how the information in the various parts
of the structure is used.

   The following table describes the possible values returned by
`typeof' and what they are.

     `"NULL"'      NULL
     `"symbol"'    a variable name
     `"pairlist"'  a pairlist object (mainly internal)
     `"closure"'   a function
     `"environment"'an environment
     `"promise"'   an object used to implement lazy evaluation
     `"language"'  an R language construct
     `"special"'   an internal function that does not evaluate
                   its arguments
     `"builtin"'   an internal function that evaluates its
                   arguments
     `"char"'      a `scalar' string object (internal only) ***
     `"logical"'   a vector containing logical values
     `"integer"'   a vector containing integer values
     `"double"'    a vector containing real values
     `"complex"'   a vector containing complex values
     `"character"' a vector containing character values
     `"..."'       the special variable length argument ***
     `"any"'       a special type that matches all types: there
                   are no objects of this type
     `"expression"'an expression object
     `"list"'      a list
     `"bytecode"'  byte code (internal only) ***
     `"externalptr"'an external pointer object
     `"weakref"'   a weak reference object
     `"raw"'       a vector containing bytes
     `"S4"'        an S4 object which is not a simple object

Users cannot easily get hold of objects of types marked with a `***'.

   Function `mode' gives information about the "mode" of an object in
the sense of Becker, Chambers & Wilks (1988), and is more compatible
with other implementations of the S language.  Finally, the function
`storage.mode' returns the "storage mode" of its argument in the sense
of Becker et al. (1988).  It is generally used when calling functions
written in another language, such as C or FORTRAN, to ensure that R
objects have the data type expected by the routine being called.  (In
the S language, vectors with integer or real values are both of mode
`"numeric"', so their storage modes need to be distinguished.)

     > x <- 1:3
     > typeof(x)
     [1] "integer"
     > mode(x)
     [1] "numeric"
     > storage.mode(x)
     [1] "integer"

   R objects are often coerced to different types during computations.
There are also many functions available to perform explicit coercion.
When programming in the R language the type of an object generally
doesn't affect the computations, however, when dealing with foreign
languages or the operating system it is often necessary to ensure that
an object is of the correct type.

2.1.1 Vectors
-------------

Vectors can be thought of as contiguous cells containing data.  Cells
are accessed through indexing operations such as `x[5]'.  More details
are given in *note Indexing::.

   R has six basic (`atomic') vector types: logical, integer, real,
complex, string (or character) and raw.  The modes and storage modes for
the different vector types are listed in the following table.

     typeof        mode          storage.mode
     ------------------------------------------ 
     `logical'     `logical'     `logical'
     `integer'     `numeric'     `integer'
     `double'      `numeric'     `double'
     `complex'     `complex'     `complex'
     `character'   `character'   `character'
     `raw'         `raw'         `raw'

   Single numbers, such as `4.2', and strings, such as `"four point
two"' are still vectors, of length 1; there are no more basic types.
Vectors with length zero are possible (and useful).

   String vectors have mode and storage mode `"character"'. A single
element of a character vector is often referred to as a _character
string_.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: List objects,  Next: Language objects,  Prev: Vector objects,  Up: Basic types

2.1.2 Lists
-----------

Lists ("generic vectors") are another kind of data storage.  Lists have
elements, each of which can contain any type of R object, i.e.  the
elements of a list do not have to be of the same type.  List elements
are accessed through three different indexing operations.  These are
explained in detail in *note Indexing::.

   Lists are vectors, and the basic vector types are referred to as
_atomic vectors_ where it is necessary to exclude lists.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Language objects,  Next: Expression objects,  Prev: List objects,  Up: Basic types

2.1.3 Language objects
----------------------

There are three types of objects that constitute the R language.  They
are _calls_, _expressions_, and _names_.  Since R has objects of type
`"expression"' we will try to avoid the use of the word expression in
other contexts.  In particular syntactically correct expressions will
be referred to as _statements_.  

   These objects have modes `"call"', `"expression"', and `"name"',
respectively.

   They can be created directly from expressions using the `quote'
mechanism and converted to and from lists by the `as.list' and
`as.call' functions.  Components of the parse tree can be extracted
using the standard indexing operations.

* Menu:

* Symbol objects::


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Symbol objects,  Prev: Language objects,  Up: Language objects

2.1.3.1 Symbol objects
......................

Symbols refer to R objects.  The name of any R object is usually a
symbol.  Symbols can be created through the functions `as.name' and
`quote'.

   Symbols have mode `"name"', storage mode `"symbol"', and type
`"symbol"'.  They can be coerced to and from character strings using
`as.character' and `as.name'.  They naturally appear as atoms of parsed
expressions, try e.g.  `as.list(quote(x + y))'.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Expression objects,  Next: Function objects,  Prev: Language objects,  Up: Basic types

2.1.4 Expression objects
------------------------

In R one can have objects of type `"expression"'.  An _expression_
contains one or more statements.  A statement is a syntactically
correct collection of tokens.  Expression objects are special language
objects which contain parsed but unevaluated R statements.  The main
difference is that an expression object can contain several such
expressions.  Another more subtle difference is that objects of type
`"expression"' are only evaluated when explicitly passed to `eval',
whereas other language objects may get evaluated in some unexpected
cases.

   An expression object behaves much like a list and its components
should be accessed in the same way as the components of a list.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Function objects,  Next: NULL object,  Prev: Expression objects,  Up: Basic types

2.1.5 Function objects
----------------------

In R functions are objects and can be manipulated in much the same way
as any other object.  Functions (or more precisely, function closures)
have three basic components:  a formal argument list, a body and an environment.
The argument list is a comma-separated list of arguments.  An argument
can be a symbol, or a `SYMBOL = DEFAULT' construct, or the special
argument `...'.  The second form of argument is used to specify a
default value for an argument.  This value will be used if the function
is called without any value specified for that argument.  The `...'
argument is special and can contain any number of arguments.  It is
generally used if the number of arguments is unknown or in cases where
the arguments will be passed on to another function.

   The body is a parsed R statement.  It is usually a collection of
statements in braces but it can be a single statement, a symbol or even
a constant.

   A function's environment is the environment that was active at the
time that the function was created.  Any symbols bound in that
environment are _captured_ and available to the function. This
combination of the code of the function and the bindings in its
environment is called a `function closure', a term from functional
programming theory. In this document we generally use the term
`function', but use `closure' to emphasize the importance of the
attached environment.

   It is possible to extract and manipulate the three parts of a closure
object using `formals', `body', and `environment' constructs (all three
can also be used on the left hand side of assignments).  The last of
these can be used to remove unwanted environment capture.

   When a function is called, a new environment (called the _evaluation
environment_) is created, whose enclosure (see *note Environment
objects::) is the environment from the function closure.  This new
environment is initially populated with the unevaluated arguments to
the function; as evaluation proceeds, local variables are created
within it.

   There is also a facility for converting functions to and from list
structures using `as.list' and `as.function'.  These have been included
to provide compatibility with S and their use is discouraged.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: NULL object,  Next: Builtin objects and special forms,  Prev: Function objects,  Up: Basic types

2.1.6 NULL
----------

There is a special object called `NULL'.  It is used whenever there is
a need to indicate or specify that an object is absent.  It should not
be confused with a vector or list of zero length.  

   The `NULL' object has no type and no modifiable properties.  There
is only one `NULL' object in R, to which all instances refer. To test
for `NULL' use `is.null'.  You cannot set attributes on `NULL'.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Builtin objects and special forms,  Next: Promise objects,  Prev: NULL object,  Up: Basic types

2.1.7 Builtin objects and  special forms
----------------------------------------

These two kinds of object contain the builtin functions of R, i.e.,
those that are displayed as `.Primitive' in code listings (as well as
those accessed via the `.Internal' function and hence not user-visible
as objects).  The difference between the two lies in the argument
handling.  Builtin functions have all their arguments evaluated and
passed to the internal function, in accordance with _call-by-value_,
whereas special functions pass the unevaluated arguments to the
internal function.

   From the R language, these objects are just another kind of function.
The `is.primitive' function can distinguish them from interpreted functions.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Promise objects,  Next: Dot-dot-dot,  Prev: Builtin objects and special forms,  Up: Basic types

2.1.8 Promise objects
---------------------

Promise objects are part of R's lazy evaluation mechanism.  They
contain three slots: a value, an expression, and an environment.  When a function
is called the arguments are matched and then each of the formal
arguments is bound to a promise.  The expression that was given for that
formal argument and a pointer to the environment the function was called
from are stored in the promise.

   Until that argument is accessed there is no _value_ associated with
the promise.  When the argument is accessed, the stored expression is evaluated
in the stored environment, and the result is returned.  The result is
also saved by the promise.  The `substitute' function will extract the
content of the expression slot.  This allows the programmer to access
either the value or the expression associated with the promise.

   Within the R language, promise objects are almost only seen
implicitly: actual function arguments are of this type.  There is also a
`delayedAssign' function that will make a promise out of an expression.
There is generally no way in R code to check whether an object is a
promise or not, nor is there a way to use R code to determine the
environment of a promise.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Dot-dot-dot,  Next: Environment objects,  Prev: Promise objects,  Up: Basic types

2.1.9 Dot-dot-dot
-----------------

The `...' object type is stored as a type of pairlist.  The components
of `...' can be accessed in the usual pairlist manner from C code, but
is not easily accessed as an object in interpreted code.  The object
can be captured as a list, so for example in `table' one sees

         args <- list(...)
     ## ....
         for (a in args) {
     ## ....

   If a function has `...' as a formal argument then any actual
arguments that do not match a formal argument are matched with `...'.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Environment objects,  Next: Pairlist objects,  Prev: Dot-dot-dot,  Up: Basic types

2.1.10 Environments
-------------------

Environments can be thought of as consisting of two things.  A _frame_,
consisting of a set of symbol-value pairs, and an _enclosure_, a
pointer to an enclosing environment. When R looks up the value for a
symbol the frame is examined and if a matching symbol is found its
value will be returned.  If not, the enclosing environment is then
accessed and the process repeated.  Environments form a tree structure
in which the enclosures play the role of parents.  The tree of
environments is rooted in an empty environment, available through
`emptyenv()', which has no parent.  It is the direct parent of the
environment of the base package (available through the `baseenv()'
function). Formerly `baseenv()' had the special value `NULL', but as
from version 2.4.0, the use of `NULL' as an environment is defunct.

   Environments are created implicitly by function calls, as described
in *note Function objects:: and *note Lexical environment::.  In this
case the environment contains the variables local to the function
(including the arguments), and its enclosure is the environment of the
currently called function.  Environments may also be created directly
by `new.env'.  The frame content of an environment can be accessed and
manipulated by use of `ls', `get' and `assign' as well as `eval' and
`evalq'.

   The `parent.env' function may be used to access the enclosure of an
environment.

   Unlike most other R objects, environments are not copied when passed
to functions or used in assignments.  Thus, if you assign the same
environment to several symbols and change one, the others will change
too.  In particular, assigning attributes to an environment can lead to
surprises.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Pairlist objects,  Next: Any-type,  Prev: Environment objects,  Up: Basic types

2.1.11 Pairlist objects
-----------------------

Pairlist objects are similar to Lisp's dotted-pair lists.  They are used
extensively in the internals of R, but are rarely visible in
interpreted code, although they are returned by `formals', and can be
created by (e.g.) the `pairlist' function. A zero-length pairlist is
`NULL', as would be expected in Lisp but in contrast to a zero-length
list.  Each such object has three slots, a CAR value, a CDR value and a
TAG value.  The TAG value is a text string and CAR and CDR usually
represent, respectively, a list item (head) and the remainder (tail) of
the list with a NULL object as terminator (the CAR/CDR terminology is
traditional Lisp and originally referred to the address and decrement
registers on an early 60's IBM computer).

   Pairlists are handled in the R language in exactly the same way as
generic vectors ("lists").  In particular, elements are accessed using
the same `[[]]' syntax.  The use of pairlists is deprecated since
generic vectors are usually more efficient to use.  When an internal
pairlist is accessed from R it is generally (including when subsetted)
converted to a generic vector.

   In a very few cases pairlists are user-visible: one is `.Options'.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Any-type,  Prev: Pairlist objects,  Up: Basic types

2.1.12 The "Any" type
---------------------

It is not really possible for an object to be of "Any" type, but it is
nevertheless a valid type value.  It gets used in certain (rather rare)
circumstances, e.g. `as.vector(x, "any")', indicating that type coercion
should not be done.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Attributes,  Next: Special compound objects,  Prev: Basic types,  Up: Objects

2.2 Attributes
==============

All objects except `NULL' can have one or more attributes attached to
them.  Attributes are stored as a pairlist where all elements are
named, but should be thought of as a set of name=value pairs.  A listing
of the attributes can be obtained using `attributes' and set by
`attributes<-', individual components are accessed using `attr' and
`attr<-'.  

   Some attributes have special accessor functions (e.g. `levels<-' for
factors) and these should be used when available. In addition to hiding
details of implementation they may perform additional operations.  R
attempts to intercept calls to `attr<-' and to `attributes<-' that
involve the special attributes and enforces the consistency checks.

   Matrices and arrays are simply vectors with the attribute `dim' and
optionally `dimnames' attached to the vector.

   Attributes are used to implement the class structure used in R.  If
an object has a `class' attribute then that attribute will be examined
during evaluation.  The class structure in R is described in detail in
*note Object-oriented programming::.

* Dimensions::

File: R-lang.info,  Node: Names,  Next: Dimensions,  Prev: Attributes,  Up: Attributes

2.2.1 Names
-----------

A `names' attribute, when present, labels the individual elements of a
vector or list.  When an object is printed the `names' attribute, when
present, is used to label the elements.  The `names' attribute can also
be used for indexing purposes, for example, `quantile(x)["25%"]'.

   One may get and set the names using `names' and `names<-'
constructions.  The latter will perform the necessary consistency
checks to ensure that the names attribute has the proper type and
length.

   Pairlists and one-dimensional arrays are treated specially. For
pairlist objects, a virtual `names' attribute is used; the `names'
attribute is really constructed from the tags of the list components.
For one-dimensional arrays the `names' attribute really accesses
`dimnames[[1]]'.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Dimensions,  Next: Dimnames,  Prev: Names,  Up: Attributes

2.2.2 Dimensions
----------------

The `dim' attribute is used to implement arrays.  The content of the
array is stored in a vector in column-major order and the `dim'
attribute is a vector of integers specifying the respective extents of
the array.  R ensures that the length of the vector is the product of
the lengths of the dimensions. The length of one or more dimensions may
be zero.

   A vector is not the same as a one-dimensional array since the latter
has a `dim' attribute of length one, whereas the former has no `dim'
attribute.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Dimnames,  Next: Classes,  Prev: Dimensions,  Up: Attributes

2.2.3 Dimnames
--------------

Arrays may name each dimension separately using the `dimnames'
attribute which is a list of character vectors.  The `dimnames' list
may itself have names which are then used for extent headings when
printing arrays.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Classes,  Next: Time series attributes,  Prev: Dimnames,  Up: Attributes

2.2.4 Classes
-------------

R has an elaborate class system(1), principally controlled via the
`class' attribute.  This attribute is a character vector containing the
list of classes that an object inherits from.  This forms the basis of
the "generic methods" functionality in R.

   This attribute can be accessed and manipulated virtually without
restriction by users.  There is no checking that an object actually
contains the components that class methods expect.  Thus, altering the
`class' attribute should be done with caution, and when they are
available specific creation and coercion functions should be preferred.

2.2.5 Time series attributes
----------------------------

The `tsp' attribute is used to hold parameters of time series, start,
end, and frequency.  This construction is mainly used to handle series
with periodic substructure such as monthly or quarterly data.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Copying of attributes,  Prev: Time series attributes,  Up: Attributes

2.2.6 Copying of attributes
---------------------------

Whether attributes should be copied when an object is altered is a
complex area, but there are some general rules (Becker, Chambers &
Wilks, 1988, pp. 144-6).

   Scalar functions (those which operate element-by-element on a vector
and whose output is similar to the input) should preserve attributes
(except perhaps class).

   Binary operations normally copy most attributes from the longer
argument (and if they are of the same length from both, preferring the
values on the first).  Here `most' means all except the `names', `dim'
and `dimnames' which are set appropriately by the code for the operator.

   Subsetting (other than by an empty index) generally drops all
attributes except `names', `dim' and `dimnames' which are reset as
appropriate.  On the other hand, subassignment generally preserves
attributes even if the length is changed.  Coercion drops all
attributes.

   The default method for sorting drops all attributes except names,
which are sorted along with the object.

File: R-lang.info,  Node: Factors,  Next: Data frame objects,  Prev: Special compound objects,  Up: Special compound objects

2.3.1 Factors
-------------

Factors are used to describe items that can have a finite number of
values (gender, social class, etc.).  A factor has a `levels' attribute
and class `"factor"'.  Optionally, it may also contain a `contrasts'
attribute which controls the parametrisation used when the factor is
used in a modeling functions.

   A factor may be purely nominal or may have ordered categories.  In
the latter case, it should be defined as such and have a `class' vector
`c("ordered"," factor")'.

   Factors are currently implemented using an integer array to specify
the actual levels and a second array of names that are mapped to the
integers.  Rather unfortunately users often make use of the
implementation in order to make some calculations easier.  This,
however, is an implementation issue and is not guaranteed to hold in all
implementations of R.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Data frame objects,  Prev: Factors,  Up: Special compound objects

2.3.2 Data frame objects
------------------------

Data frames are the R structures which most closely mimic the SAS or
SPSS data set, i.e. a "cases by variables" matrix of data.

   A data frame is a list of vectors, factors, and/or matrices all
having the same length (number of rows in the case of matrices).  In
addition, a data frame generally has a `names' attribute labeling the
variables and a `row.names' attribute for labeling the cases.

   A data frame can contain a list that is the same length as the other
components.  The list can contain elements of differing lengths thereby
providing a data structure for ragged arrays.  However, as of this
writing such arrays are not generally handled correctly.

3 Evaluation of expressions
***************************

When a user types a command at the prompt (or when an expression is read
from a file) the first thing that happens to it is that the command is
transformed by the parser into an internal representation.  The
evaluator executes parsed R expressions and returns the value of the
expression.  All expressions have a value.  This is the core of the
language.

   This chapter describes the basic mechanisms of the evaluator, but
avoids discussion of specific functions or groups of functions which are

3.1.1 Constants
---------------

Any number typed directly at the prompt is a constant and is evaluated.

     > 1
     [1] 1

Perhaps unexpectedly, the number returned from the expression `1' is a
numeric.  In most cases, the difference between an integer and a
numeric value will be unimportant as R will do the right thing when
using the numbers.  There are, however, times when we would like to
explicitly create an integer value for a constant.  We can do this by
calling the function `as.integer' or using various other techniques.
But perhaps the simplest approach is to qualify our constant with the
suffix character `L'.  For example, to create the integer value 1, we
might use

     > 1L
     [1]

   We can use the `L' suffix to qualify any number with the intent of
making it an explicit integer.  So `0x10L' creates the integer value 16
from the hexadecimal representation.  The constant `1e3L' gives 1000 as
an integer rather than a numeric value and is equivalent to `1000L'.
(Note that the `L' is treated as qualifying the term `1e3' and not the
`3'.)  If we qualify a value with `L' that is not an integer value,
e.g. `1e-3L', we get a warning and the numeric value is created.  A
warning is also created if there is an unnecessary decimal point in the
number, e.g. `1.L'.

   We get a syntax error when using `L' with complex numbers, e.g.
`12iL' gives an error.

   Constants are fairly boring and to do more we need symbols.

3.1.2 Symbol lookup
-------------------

When a new variable is created it must have a name so it can be
referenced and it usually has a value.  The name itself is a symbol.
When a symbol is evaluated its value is returned.  Later we shall
explain in detail how to determine the value associated with a symbol.

   In this small example `y' is a symbol and its value is 4.  A symbol
is an R object too, but one rarely needs to deal with symbols directly,
except when doing "programming on the language" (*note Computing on the
language::).

     > y <- 4
     > y
     [1] 4


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Function calls,  Next: Operators,  Prev: Symbol lookup,  Up: Simple evaluation

3.1.3 Function calls
--------------------

Most of the computations carried out in R involve the evaluation of
functions.  We will also refer to this as function _invocation_.
Functions are invoked by name with a list of arguments separated by
commas.

     > mean(1:10)
     [1] 5.5

In this example the function `mean' was called with one argument, the
vector of integers from 1 to 10.

   R contains a huge number of functions with different purposes.  Most
are used for producing a result which is an R object, but others are
used for their side effects, e.g., printing and plotting functions.

   Function calls can have _tagged_ (or _named_) arguments, as in
`plot(x, y, pch = 3)' arguments without tags are known as _positional_
since the function must distinguish their meaning from their sequential
positions among the arguments of the call, e.g., that `x' denotes the
abscissa variable and `y' the ordinate.  The use of tags/names is an
obvious convenience for functions with a large number of optional
arguments.

   A special type of function calls can appear on the left hand side of
the assignment operator as in

     > class(x) <- "foo"

What this construction really does is to call the function `class<-'
with the original object and the right hand side.  This function
performs the modification of the object and returns the result which is
then stored back into the original variable.  (At least conceptually,
this is what happens.  Some additional effort is made to avoid
unnecessary data duplication.)

3.1.4 Operators
---------------

R allows the use of arithmetic expressions using operators similar to
those of the C programming language, for instance

     > 1 + 2
     [1] 3

   Expressions can be grouped using parentheses, mixed with function
calls, and assigned to variables in a straightforward manner

     > y <- 2 * (a + log(x))

   R contains a number of operators.  They are listed in the table
below.

     `-'     Minus, can be unary or binary
     `+'     Plus, can be unary or binary
     `!'     Unary not
     `~'     Tilde, used for model formulae, can be either
             unary or binary
     `?'     Help
     `:'     Sequence, binary (in model formulae:
             interaction)
     `*'     Multiplication, binary
     `/'     Division, binary
     `^'     Exponentiation, binary
     `%X%'   Special binary operators, X can be replaced by
             any valid name
     `%%'    Modulus, binary
     `%/%'   Integer divide, binary
     `%*%'   Matrix product, binary
     `%o%'   Outer product, binary
     `%x%'   Kronecker product, binary
     `%in%'  Matching operator, binary (in model formulae:
             nesting)
     `<'     Less than, binary
     `>'     Greater than, binary
     `=='    Equal to, binary
     `>='    Greater than or equal to, binary
     `<='    Less than or equal to, binary
     `&'     And, binary, vectorized
     `&&'    And, binary, not vectorized
     `|'     Or, binary, vectorized
     `||'    Or, binary, not vectorized
     `<-'    Left assignment, binary
     `->'    Right assignment, binary
     `$'     List subset, binary

   Except for the syntax, there is no difference between applying an
operator and calling a function.  In fact, `x + y' can equivalently be
written ``+`(x, y)'.  Notice that since `+' is a non-standard function
name, it needs to be quoted.

   R deals with entire vectors of data at a time, and most of the
elementary operators and basic mathematical functions like `log' are
vectorized (as indicated in the table above).  This means that e.g.
adding two vectors of the same length will create a vector containing
the element-wise sums, implicitly looping over the vector index.  This
applies also to other operators like `-', `*', and `/' as well as to
higher dimensional structures.  Notice in particular that multiplying
two matrices does not produce the usual matrix product (the `%*%'
operator exists for that purpose).  Some finer points relating to
vectorized operations will be discussed in *note Elementary arithmetic
operations::.

   To access individual elements of an atomic vector, one generally uses
the `x[i]' construction.

     > x <- rnorm(5)
     > x
     [1] -0.12526937 -0.27961154 -1.03718717 -0.08156527  1.37167090
     > x[2]
     [1] -0.2796115

   List components are more commonly accessed using `x$a' or `x[[i]]'.

     > x <- options()
     > x$prompt
     [1] "> "

   Indexing constructs can also appear on the right hand side of an assignment.

   Like the other operators, indexing is really done by functions, and
one could have used  ``[`(x, 2)' instead of `x[2]'.

   R's indexing operations contain many advanced features which are
further described in *note Indexing::.

3.2 Control structures
======================

Computation in R consists of sequentially evaluating _statements_.
Statements, such as `x<-1:10' or `mean(y)', can be separated by either
a semi-colon or a new line.  Whenever the evaluator is presented with a
syntactically complete statement that statement is evaluated and the
_value_ returned.  The result of evaluating a statement can be referred
to as the value of the statement(1)  The value can always be assigned
to a symbol.

   Both semicolons and new lines can be used to separate statements.  A
semicolon always indicates the end of a statement while a new line
_may_ indicate the end of a statement.  If the current statement is not
syntactically complete new lines are simply ignored by the evaluator.
If the session is interactive the prompt changes from `>' to `+'.

     > x <- 0; x + 5
     [1] 5
     > y <- 1:10
     > 1; 2
     [1] 1
     [1] 2

   Statements can be grouped together using braces `{' and `}'.  A
group of statements is sometimes called a _block_.  Single statements
are evaluated when a new line is typed at the end of the syntactically
complete statement.  Blocks are not evaluated until a new line is
entered after the closing brace.  In the remainder of this section,
_statement_ refers to either a single statement or a block.

     > { x <- 0
     + x + 5
     + }
     [1] 5

   (1) Evaluation always takes place in an environment.  See *note
Scope of variables:: for more details.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: if,  Next: Looping,  Prev: Control structures,  Up: Control structures

3.2.1 if
--------

The `if'/`else' statement conditionally evaluates two statements.
There is a _condition_ which is evaluated and if the _value_ is `TRUE'
then the first statement is evaluated; otherwise the second statement
will be evaluated.  The `if'/`else' statement returns, as its value,
the value of the statement that was selected.  The formal syntax is

     if ( STATEMENT1 )
         STATEMENT2
     else
         STATEMENT3

   First, STATEMENT1 is evaluated to yield VALUE1.  If VALUE1 is a
logical vector with first element `TRUE' then STATEMENT2 is evaluated.
If the first element of VALUE1 is `FALSE' then STATEMENT3 is evaluated.
If VALUE1 is a numeric vector then STATEMENT3 is evaluated when the
first element of VALUE1 is zero and otherwise STATEMENT2 is evaluated.
Only the first element of VALUE1 is used.  All other elements are
ignored.  If VALUE1 has any type other than a logical or a numeric
vector an error is signalled.

   If/else statements can be used to avoid numeric problems such as
taking the logarithm of a negative number.  Because if/else statements
are the same as other statements you can assign the value of them.  The
two examples below are equivalent.

     > if( any(x <= 0) ) y <- log(1+x) else y <- log(x)
     > y <- if( any(x <= 0) ) log(1+x) else log(x)

   The `else' clause is optional.  The statement `if(any(x <= 0)) x <-
x[x <= 0]' is valid.  When the `if' statement is not in a block the
`else', if present, must appear on the same line as the end of
STATEMENT2.  Otherwise the new line at the end of STATEMENT2 completes
the `if' and yields a syntactically complete statement that is
evaluated.  A simple solution is to use a compound statement wrapped in
braces, putting the `else' on the same line as the closing brace that
marks the end of the statement.

   If/else statements can be nested.

     if ( STATEMENT1 ) {
         STATEMENT2
     } else if ( STATEMENT3 ) {
         STATEMENT4
     } else if ( STATEMENT5 ) {
         STATEMENT6
     } else
         STATEMENT8

   One of the even numbered statements will be evaluated and the
resulting value returned.  If the optional `else' clause is omitted and
all the odd numbered STATEMENT's evaluate to `FALSE' no statement will
be evaluated and `NULL' is returned.

   The odd numbered STATEMENTs are evaluated, in order, until one
evaluates to `TRUE' and then the associated even numbered STATEMENT is
evaluated.  In this example, STATEMENT6 will only be evaluated if
STATEMENT1 is `FALSE' and STATEMENT3 is `FALSE' and STATEMENT5 is
`TRUE'.  There is no limit to the number of `else if' clauses that are
permitted.

3.2.2 Looping
-------------

R has three statements that provide explicit looping.(1)  They are
`for', `while' and `repeat'.  The two built-in constructs, `next' and
`break', provide additional control over the evaluation.  Each of the
three statements returns the value of the last statement that was
evaluated.  It is possible, although uncommon, to assign the result of
one of these statements to a symbol.  R provides other functions for
implicit looping such as `tapply', `apply', and `lapply'.  In addition
many operations, especially arithmetic ones, are vectorized so you may
not need to use a loop.

   There are two statements that can be used to explicitly control
looping.  They are `break' and `next'.  The `break' statement causes an
exit from the innermost loop that is currently being executed.  The
`next' statement immediately causes control to return to the start of
the loop.  The next iteration of the loop (if there is one) is then
executed.  No statement below `next' in the current loop is evaluated.

   The value returned by a loop statement statement is always `NULL'
and is returned invisibly.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Looping is the repeated evaluation of a statement or block of
statements.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: repeat,  Next: while,  Prev: Looping,  Up: Control structures

3.2.3 repeat
------------

The `repeat' statement causes repeated evaluation of the body until a
break is specifically requested.  This means that you need to be
careful when using `repeat' because of the danger of an infinite loop.
The syntax of the `repeat' loop is

     repeat STATEMENT

   When using `repeat', STATEMENT must be a block statement.  You need
to both perform some computation and test whether or not to break from
the loop and usually this requires two statements.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: while,  Next: for,  Prev: repeat,  Up: Control structures

3.2.4 while
-----------

The `while' statement is very similar to the `repeat' statement.  The
syntax of the `while' loop is

     while ( STATEMENT1 ) STATEMENT2

where STATEMENT1 is evaluated and if its value is `TRUE' then
STATEMENT2 is evaluated.  This process continues until STATEMENT1
evaluates to `FALSE'.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: for,  Next: switch,  Prev: while,  Up: Control structures

3.2.5 for
---------

The syntax of the `for' loop is

     for ( NAME in VECTOR )
        STATEMENT1

where VECTOR can be either a vector or a list.  For each element in
VECTOR the variable NAME is set to the value of that element and
STATEMENT1 is evaluated.  A side effect is that the variable NAME still
exists after the loop has concluded and it has the value of the last
element of VECTOR that the loop was evaluated for.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: switch,  Prev: for,  Up: Control structures

3.2.6 switch
------------

Technically speaking, `switch' is just another function, but its
semantics are close to those of control structures of other programming
languages.

   The syntax is

     switch (STATEMENT, LIST)

where the elements of LIST may be named.  First, STATEMENT is evaluated
and the result, VALUE, obtained.  If VALUE is a number between 1 and
the length of LIST then the corresponding element LIST is evaluated and
the result returned.  If VALUE is too large or too small `NULL' is
returned.

     > x <- 3
     > switch(x, 2+2, mean(1:10), rnorm(5))
     [1]  2.2903605  2.3271663 -0.7060073  1.3622045 -0.2892720
     > switch(2, 2+2, mean(1:10), rnorm(5))
     [1] 5.5
     > switch(6, 2+2, mean(1:10), rnorm(5))
     NULL

   If VALUE is a character vector then the element of `...' with a name
that exactly matches VALUE is evaluated.  If there is no match a single
unnamed argument will be used as a default.  If no default is
specified, `NULL' is returned.

     > y <- "fruit"
     > switch(y, fruit = "banana", vegetable = "broccoli", "Neither")
     [1] "banana"
     > y <- "meat"
     > switch(y, fruit = "banana", vegetable = "broccoli", "Neither")
     [1] "Neither"

   A common use of `switch' is to branch according to the character
value of one of the arguments to a function.

     > centre <- function(x, type) {
     + switch(type,
     +        mean = mean(x),
     +        median = median(x),
     +        trimmed = mean(x, trim = .1))
     + }
     > x <- rcauchy(10)
     > centre(x, "mean")
     [1] 0.8760325
     > centre(x, "median")
     [1] 0.5360891
     > centre(x, "trimmed")
     [1] 0.6086504

   `switch' returns either the value of the statement that was
evaluated or `NULL' if no statement was evaluated.

   To choose from a list of alternatives that already exists `switch'
may not be the best way to select one for evaluation.  It is often
better to use `eval' and the subset operator, `[[', directly via
`eval(x[[condition]])'.

3.3.1 Recycling rules
---------------------

If one tries to add two structures with a different number of elements,
then the shortest is recycled to length of longest.  That is, if for
instance you add `c(1, 2, 3)' to a six-element vector then you will
really add `c(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)'.  If the length of the longer vector
is not a multiple of the shorter one, a warning is given.

   As from R 1.4.0, any arithmetic operation involving a zero-length
vector has a zero-length result.

   One exception is that when adding vectors to matrices, a warning is
not given if the lengths are incompatible.

(matrix+matrix, dimensions must match. vector+matrix: first recycle,
then check if dims fit, error if not)


File: R-lang.info,  Node: NA handling,  Prev: Dimensional attributes,  Up: Elementary arithmetic operations

3.3.4 NA handling
-----------------

Missing values in the statistical sense, that is, variables whose value
is not known, have the value `NA'. This should not be confused with the
`missing' property for a function argument that has not been supplied
(see *note Arguments::).  

   As the elements of an atomic vector must be of the same type there
are multiple types of `NA' values.  There is one case where this is
particularly important to the user.  The default type of `NA' is
`logical', unless coerced to some other type, so the appearance of a
missing value may trigger logical rather than numeric indexing (see
*note Indexing:: for details).

   Numeric and logical calculations with `NA' generally return `NA'. In
cases where the result of the operation would be the same for all
possible values the `NA' could take, the operation may return this
value. In particular, `FALSE & NA' is `FALSE', `TRUE | NA' is `TRUE'.
`NA' is not equal to any other value or to itself; testing for `NA' is
done using `is.na'.  However, an `NA' value will match another `NA'
value in `match'.

   Numeric calculations whose result is undefined, such as `0/0',
produce the value `NaN'.  This exists only in the `double' type and for
real or imaginary components of the complex type.  The function
`is.nan' is provided to check specifically for `NaN', `is.na' also
returns `TRUE' for `NaN'.  Coercing `NaN' to logical or integer type
gives an `NA' of the appropriate type, but coercion to character gives
the string `"NaN"'.  `NaN' values are incomparable so tests of equality
or collation involving `NaN' will result in `NA'.  They are regarded as
matching any `NaN' value (and no other value, not even `NA') by `match'.

   The `NA' of character type is as from R 1.5.0 distinct from the
string `"NA"'.  Programmers who need to specify an explicit string `NA'
should use `as.character(NA)' rather than `"NA"', or set elements to
`NA' using `is.na<-'.

   As from R 2.5.0 there are constants `NA_integer_', `NA_real_',
`NA_complex_' and `NA_character_' which will generate (in the parser)
an `NA' value of the appropriate type, and will be used in deparsing
when it is not otherwise possible to identify the type of an `NA' (and
the `control' options ask for this to be done).

   There is no `NA' value for raw vectors.

3.4 Indexing
============

R contains several constructs which allow access to individual elements
or subsets through indexing operations.  In the case of the basic
vector types one can access the i-th element using `x[i]', but there is
also indexing of lists, matrices, and multi-dimensional arrays.  There
are several forms of indexing in addition to indexing with a single
integer.  Indexing can be used both to extract part of an object and to
replace parts of an object (or to add parts).

   R has three basic indexing operators, with syntax displayed by the
following examples

     x[i]
     x[i, j]
     x[[i]]
     x[[i, j]]
     x$a
     x$"a"
   
   For vectors and matrices the `[[' forms are rarely used, although
they have some slight semantic differences from the `[' form (e.g.  it
drops any `names' or `dimnames' attribute, and that partial matching is
used for character indices).  When indexing multi-dimensional
structures with a single index, `x[[i]]' or `x[i]' will return the
`i'th sequential element of `x'.

   For lists, one generally uses `[[' to select any single element,
whereas `[' returns a list of the selected elements.

   The `[[' form allows only a single element to be selected using
integer or character indices, whereas `[' allows indexing by vectors.
Note though that for a list or other recursive object, the index can be
a vector and each element of the vector is applied in turn to the list,
the selected component, the selected component of that component, and
so on. The result is still a single element.

   The form using `$' applies to recursive objects such as lists and
pairlists.  It allows only a literal character string or a symbol as the
index.  That is, the index is not computable: for cases where you need
to evaluate an expression to find the index, use `x[[expr]]'.  When `$'
is applied to a non-recursive object the result used to be always
`NULL': as from R 2.6.0 this is an error.

3.4.1 Indexing by vectors
-------------------------

R allows some powerful constructions using vectors as indices.  We
shall discuss indexing of simple vectors first.  For simplicity, assume
that the expression is `x[i]'.  Then the following possibilities exist
according to the type of `i'.

   * *Integer*.  All elements of `i' must have the same sign.  If they
     are positive, the elements of `x' with those index numbers are
     selected.  If `i' contains negative elements, all elements except
     those indicated are selected.

     If `i' is positive and exceeds `length(x)' then the corresponding
     selection is `NA'.  A negative out of bounds value for `i' causes
     an error.

     A special case is the zero index, which has null effects: `x[0]' is
     an empty vector and otherwise including zeros among positive or
     negative indices has the same effect as if they were omitted.

   * *Other numeric*.  Non-integer values are converted to integer (by
     truncation towards zero) before use.

   * *Logical*.  The indexing `i' should generally have the same length
     as `x'.  If it is shorter, then its elements will be recycled as
     discussed in *note Elementary arithmetic operations::.  If it is
     longer, then `x' is conceptually extended with `NA's. The selected
     values of `x' are those for which `i' is `TRUE'.

   * *Character*.  The strings in `i' are matched against the names
     attribute of `x' and the resulting integers are used.  For `[['
     and `$' partial matching is used if exact matching fails, so
     `x$aa' will match `x$aabb' if `x' does not contain a component
     named `"aa"' and `"aabb"' is the only name which has prefix
     `"aa"'.  For `[[', partial matching can be controlled via the
     `exact' argument which defaults to `NA' indicating that partial
     matching is allowed, but should result in a warning when it
     occurs.  Setting `exact' to `TRUE' prevents partial matching from
     occurring, a `FALSE' value allows it and does not issue any
     warnings.  Note that `[' always requires an exact match.  The
     string `""' is treated specially: it indicates `no name' and
     matches no element (not even those without a name).  Note that
     partial matching is only used when extracting and not when
     replacing.

   * *Factor*.  The result is identical to `x[as.integer(i)]'.  The
     factor levels are never used.  If so desired, use
     `x[as.character(i)]' or a similar construction.

   * *Empty*.  The expression `x[]' returns `x', but drops "irrelevant"
     attributes from the result.  Only `names' and in multi-dimensional
     arrays `dim' and `dimnames' attributes are retained.

   * *NULL*.  This is treated as if it were `integer(0)'.


   Indexing with a missing (i.e. `NA') value gives an `NA' result.
This rule applies also to the case of logical indexing, i.e. the
elements of `x' that have an `NA' selector in `i' get included in the
result, but their value will be `NA'.  

   Notice however, that there are different modes of `NA'--the literal
constant is of mode `"logical"', but it is frequently automatically
coerced to other types.  One effect of this is that `x[NA]' has the
length of `x', but `x[c(1, NA)]' has length 2.  That is because the
rules for logical indices apply in the former case, but those for
integer indices in the latter.

   Indexing with `[' will also carry out the relevant subsetting of any
names attributes.

3.4.2 Indexing matrices and arrays
----------------------------------

Subsetting multi-dimensional structures generally follows the same rules
as single-dimensional indexing for each index variable, with the
relevant component of `dimnames' taking the place of `names'.  A couple
of special rules apply, though:

   Normally, a structure is accessed using the number of indices
corresponding to its dimension.  It is however also possible to use a
single index in which case the `dim' and `dimnames' attributes are
disregarded and the result is effectively that of `c(m)[i]'.  Notice
that `m[1]' is usually very different from `m[1, ]' or `m[, 1]'.

   It is possible to use a matrix of integers as an index.  In this
case, the number of columns of the matrix should match the number of
dimensions of the structure, and the result will be a vector with length
as the number of rows of the matrix.  The following example shows how
to extract the elements `m[1, 1]' and `m[2, 2]' in one operation.

     > m <- matrix(1:4, 2)
     > m
          [,1] [,2]
     [1,]    1    3
     [2,]    2    4
     > i <- matrix(c(1, 1, 2, 2), 2, byrow = TRUE)
     > i
          [,1] [,2]
     [1,]    1    1
     [2,]    2    2
     > m[i]
     [1] 1 4

Negative indices are not allowed in indexing matrices.  `NA' and zero
values are allowed: rows in an index matrix containing a zero are
ignored, whereas rows containing an `NA' produce an `NA' in the result.

   Both in the case of using a single index and in matrix indexing, a
`names' attribute is used if present, as had the structure been
one-dimensional.

   If an indexing operation causes the result to have one of its
extents of length one, as in selecting a single slice of a
three-dimensional matrix with (say) `m[2, , ]', the corresponding
dimension is generally dropped from the result.  If a
single-dimensional structure results, a vector is obtained.  This is
occasionally undesirable and can be turned off by adding the `drop =
FALSE' to the indexing operation.  Notice that this is an additional
argument to the `[' function and doesn't add to the index count.  Hence
the correct way of selecting the first row of a matrix as a 1 by n
matrix is `m[1, , drop = FALSE]'.  Forgetting to disable the dropping
feature is a common cause of failure in general subroutines where an
index occasionally, but not usually has length one.  This rule still
applies to a one-dimensional array, where any subsetting will give a
vector result unless `drop = FALSE' is used.

   Notice that vectors are distinct from one-dimensional arrays in that
the latter have `dim' and `dimnames' attributes (both of length one).
One-dimensional arrays are not easily obtained from subsetting
operations but they can be constructed explicitly and are returned by
`table'.  This is sometimes useful because the elements of the
`dimnames' list may themselves be named, which is not the case for the
`names' attribute.

   Some operations such as `m[FALSE, ]' result in structures in which a
dimension has zero extent.  R generally tries to handle these
structures sensibly.

3.4.3 Indexing other structures
-------------------------------

The operator `[' is a generic function which allows class methods to be
added, and the `$' and `[[' operators likewise.  Thus, it is possible
to have user-defined indexing operations for any structure.  Such a
function, say `[.foo' is called with a set of arguments of which the
first is the structure being indexed and the rest are the indices.  In
the case of `$', the index argument is of mode `"symbol"' even when
using the `x$"abc"' form.  It is important to be aware that class
methods do not necessarily behave in the same way as the basic methods,
for example with respect to partial matching.

   The most important example of a class method for `[' is that used
for data frames.  It is not be described in detail here (see the help
page for `[.data.frame', but in broad terms, if two indices are
supplied (even if one is empty) it creates matrix-like indexing for a
structure that is basically a list of vectors of the same length.  If a
single index is supplied, it is interpreted as indexing the list of
columns--in that case the `drop' argument is ignored, with a warning.

   The basic operators `$' and `[[' can be applied to environments.
Only character indices are allowed and no partial matching is done.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Subset assignment,  Prev: Indexing other structures,  Up: Indexing

3.4.4 Subset assignment
-----------------------

Assignment to subsets of a structure is a special case of a general
mechanism for complex assignment:
     x[3:5] <- 13:15
   The result of this commands is as if the following had been executed
     `*tmp*` <- x
     x <- "[<-"(`*tmp*`, 3:5, value=13:15)
     rm(`*tmp*`)

   Note that the index is first converted to a numeric index and then
the elements are replaced sequentially along the numeric index, as if a
`for' loop had been used.  Any existing variable called ``*tmp*`' will
be overwritten and deleted, and this variable name should not be used
in code.

   The same mechanism can be applied to functions other than `['.  The
replacement function has the same name with `<-' pasted on.  Its last
argument, which must be called `value', is the new value to be
assigned.  For example,
     names(x) <- c("a","b")
   is equivalent to
     `*tmp*` <- x
     x <- "names<-"(`*tmp*`, value=c("a","b"))
     rm(`*tmp*`)

   Nesting of complex assignments is evaluated recursively
     names(x)[3] <- "Three"
   is equivalent to
     `*tmp*` <- x
     x <- "names<-"(`*tmp*`, value="[<-"(names(`*tmp*`), 3, value="Three"))
     rm(`*tmp*`)

   Complex assignments in the enclosing environment (using `<<-') are
also permitted:
     names(x)[3] <<- "Three"
   is equivalent to
     `*tmp*` <<- get(x, envir=parent.env(), inherits=TRUE)
     names(`*tmp*`)[3] <- "Three"
     x <<- `*tmp*`
     rm(`*tmp*`)
   and also to
     `*tmp*` <- get(x,envir=parent.env(), inherits=TRUE)
     x <<- "names<-"(`*tmp*`, value="[<-"(names(`*tmp*`), 3, value="Three"))
     rm(`*tmp*`)

   Only the target variable is evaluated in the enclosing environment,
so
     e<-c(a=1,b=2)
     i<-1
     local({
        e <- c(A=10,B=11)
        i <-2
        e[i] <<- e[i]+1
     })
   uses the local value of `i' on both the LHS and RHS, and the local
value of `e' on the RHS of the superassignment statement.  It sets `e'
in the outer environment to
      a  b
      1 12
   That is, the superassignment is equivalent to the four lines
     `*tmp*` <- get(x,envir=parent.env(), inherits=TRUE)
     `*tmp*`[i] <- e[i]+1
     x <<- `*tmp*`
     rm(`*tmp*`)

   Similarly
     x[is.na(x)] <<- 0
   is equivalent to
     `*tmp*` <- get(x,envir=parent.env(), inherits=TRUE)
     `*tmp*`[is.na(x)] <- 0
     x <<- `*tmp*`
     rm(`*tmp*`)
   and not to
     `*tmp*` <- get(x,envir=parent.env(), inherits=TRUE)
     `*tmp*`[is.na(`*tmp*`)] <- 0
     x <<- `*tmp*`
     rm(`*tmp*`)
   These two candidate interpretations differ only if there is also a
local variable `x'.  It is a good idea to avoid having a local variable
with the same name as the target variable of a superassignment.  As
this case was handled incorrectly in versions 1.9.1 and earlier there
must not be a serious need for such code.

3.5 Scope of variables
======================

Almost every programming language has a set of scoping rules, allowing
the same name to be used for different objects.  This allows, e.g., a
local variable in a function to have the same name as a global object.

   R uses a _lexical scoping_ model, similar to languages like Pascal.
However, R is a _functional programming language_ and allows dynamic
creation and manipulation of functions and language objects, and has
additional features reflecting this fact.

* Global environment::
* Lexical environment::
* Stacks::
* Search path::


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Global environment,  Next: Lexical environment,  Prev: Scope of variables,  Up: Scope of variables

3.5.1 Global environment
------------------------

The global environment is the root of the user workspace.  An assignment
operation from the command line will cause the relevant object to
belong to the global environment.  Its enclosing environment is the
next environment on the search path, and so on back to the empty
environment that is the enclosure of the base environment.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Lexical environment,  Next: Stacks,  Prev: Global environment,  Up: Scope of variables

3.5.2 Lexical environment
-------------------------

Every call to a function creates a _frame_ which contains the local
variables created in the function, and is evaluated in an environment,
which in combination creates a new environment.

   Notice the terminology: A frame is a set of variables, an
environment is a nesting of frames (or equivalently: the innermost
frame plus the enclosing environment).

   Environments may be assigned to variables or be contained in other
objects.  However, notice that they are not standard objects--in
particular, they are not copied on assignment.

   A closure (mode `"function"') object will contain the environment in
which it is created as part of its definition (By default.  The
environment can be manipulated using `environment<-').  When the
function is subsequently called, its evaluation environment is created
with the closure's environment as enclosure.  Notice that this is not
necessarily the environment of the caller!

   Thus, when a variable is requested inside a function, it is first
sought in the evaluation environment, then in the enclosure, the
enclosure of the enclosure, etc.; once the global environment or the
environment of a package is reached, the search continues up the search
path to the environment of the base package.  If the variable is not
found there, the search will proceed next to the empty environment, and
will fail.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Stacks,  Next: Search path,  Prev: Lexical environment,  Up: Scope of variables

3.5.3 The call stack
--------------------

Every time a function is invoked a new evaluation frame is created.  At
any point in time during the computation the currently active
environments are accessible through the _call stack_.  Each time a
function is invoked a special construct called a context is created
internally and is placed on a list of contexts.  When a function has
finished evaluating its context is removed from the call stack.

   Making variables defined higher up the call stack available is called dynamic
scope. The binding for a variable is then determined by the most recent
(in time) definition of the variable.  This contradicts the default
scoping rules in R, which use the bindings in the environment in which
the function was defined (lexical scope). Some functions, particularly
those that use and manipulate model formulas, need to simulate dynamic
scope by directly accessing the call stack.

   Access to the call stack is provided through a family of functions
which have names that start with `sys.'.  They are listed briefly below.

`sys.call'
     Get the call for the specified context.

`sys.frame'
     Get the evaluation frame for the specified context.

`sys.nframe'
     Get the environment frame for all active contexts.

`sys.function'
     Get the function being invoked in the specified context.

`sys.parent'
     Get the parent of the current function invocation.

`sys.calls'
     Get the calls for all the active contexts.

`sys.frames'
     Get the evaluation frames for all the active contexts.

`sys.parents'
     Get the numeric labels for all active contexts.

`sys.on.exit'
     Set a function to be executed when the specified context is exited.

`sys.status'
     Calls `sys.frames', `sys.parents' and `sys.calls'.

`parent.frame'
     Get the evaluation frame for the specified parent context.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Search path,  Prev: Stacks,  Up: Scope of variables

3.5.4 Search path
-----------------

In addition to the evaluation environment structure, R has a search
path of environments which are searched for variables not found
elsewhere.  This is used for two things: packages of functions and
attached user data.

   The first element of the search path is the global environment and
the last is the base package.  An `Autoloads' environment is used for
holding proxy objects that may be loaded on demand.  Other environments
are inserted in the path using `attach' or `library'.

   Packages which have a _namespace_ have a different search path.
When a search for an R object is started from an object in such a
package, the package itself is searched first, then its imports, then
the base namespace and finally the global environment and the rest of
the regular search path.  The effect is that references to other
objects in the same package will be resolved to the package, and
objects cannot be masked by objects of the same name in the global
environment or in other packages.

4.1 Writing functions
=====================

While R can be very useful as a data analysis tool most users very
quickly find themselves wanting to write their own functions.  This is
one of the real advantages of R.  Users can program it and they can, if
they want to, change the system level functions to functions that they
find more appropriate.

   R also provides facilities that make it easy to document any
functions that you have created.  *Note Writing R documentation:
(R-exts)Writing R documentation.

* Menu:

* Syntax and examples::
* Arguments::


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Syntax and examples,  Next: Arguments,  Prev: Writing functions,  Up: Writing functions

4.1.1 Syntax and examples
-------------------------

The syntax for writing a function is

     function ( ARGLIST ) BODY

   The first component of the function declaration is the keyword
`function' which indicates to R that you want to create a function.

   An argument list is a comma separated list of formal arguments.  A
formal argument can be a symbol, a statement of the form `SYMBOL =
EXPRESSION', or the special formal argument `...'.

   The _body_ can be any valid R expression.  Generally, the body is a
group of expressions contained in curly braces (`{' and `}').

   Generally functions are assigned to symbols but they don't need to
be.  The value returned by the call to `function' is a function.  If
this is not given a name it is referred to as an anonymous function.
Anonymous functions are most frequently used as arguments other
functions such as the `apply' family or `outer'.

   Here is a simple function: `echo <- function(x) print(x)'.  So
`echo' is a function that takes a single argument and when `echo' is
invoked it prints its argument.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Arguments,  Prev: Syntax and examples,  Up: Writing functions

4.1.2 Arguments
---------------

The formal arguments to the function define the variables whose values
will be supplied at the time the function is invoked.  The names of
these arguments can be used within the function body where they obtain
the value supplied at the time of function invocation.

   Default values for arguments can be specified using the special form
`NAME = EXPRESSION'.  In this case, if the user does not specify a
value for the argument when the function is invoked the expression will
be associated with the corresponding symbol.  When a value is needed
the EXPRESSION is evaluated in the evaluation frame of the function.

   Default behaviours can also be specified by using the function
`missing'.  When `missing' is called with the name of a formal argument
it returns `TRUE' if the formal argument was not matched with any
actual argument and has not been subsequently modified in the body of
the function.  An argument that is `missing' will thus have its default
value, if any. The `missing' function does not force evaluation of the
argument.

   The special type of argument `...' can contain any number of
supplied arguments.  It is used for a variety of purposes.  It allows
you to write a function that takes an arbitrary number of arguments.  It
can be used to absorb some arguments into an intermediate function which
can then be extracted by functions called subsequently.

4.2 Functions as objects
========================

Functions are first class objects in R.  They can be used anywhere that
an R object is required.  In particular they can be passed as arguments
to functions and returned as values from functions.  See *note Function
objects:: for the details.

4.3.1 Evaluation environment
----------------------------

When a function is called or invoked a new evaluation frame is created.
In this frame the formal arguments are matched with the supplied
arguments according to the rules given in *note Argument matching::.
The statements in the body of the function are evaluated sequentially in
this environment frame.

   The enclosing frame of the evaluation frame is the environment frame
associated with the function being invoked.  This may be different from
S.  While many functions have `.GlobalEnv' as their environment this
does not have to be true and functions defined in packages with
namespaces (normally) have the package namespace as their environment.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Argument matching,  Next: Argument evaluation,  Prev: Evaluation environment,  Up: Evaluation

4.3.2 Argument matching
-----------------------

This subsection applies to closures but not to primitive functions.  The
latter typically ignore tags and do positional matching, but their help
pages should be consulted for exceptions, which include `log', `round',
`signif', `rep' and `seq.int'.

   The first thing that occurs in a function evaluation is the matching
of formal to the actual or supplied arguments.  This is done by a
three-pass process:

  1. *Exact matching on tags*.  For each named supplied argument the
     list of formal arguments is searched for an item whose name
     matches exactly.  It is an error to have the same formal argument
     match several actuals or vice versa.

  2. *Partial matching on tags*.  Each remaining named supplied
     argument is compared to the remaining formal arguments using
     partial matching.  If the name of the supplied argument matches
     exactly with the first part of a formal argument then the two
     arguments are considered to be matched.  It is an error to have
     multiple partial matches.  Notice that if `f <- function(fumble,
     fooey) fbody', then `f(f = 1, fo = 2)' is illegal, even though the
     2nd actual argument only matches `fooey'.  `f(f = 1, fooey = 2)'
     _is_ legal though since the second argument matches exactly and is
     removed from consideration for partial matching.  If the formal
     arguments contain `...' then partial matching is only applied to
     arguments that precede it.

  3. *Positional matching*.  Any unmatched formal arguments are bound
     to _unnamed_ supplied arguments, in order.  If there is a `...'
     argument, it will take up the remaining arguments, tagged or not.


   If any arguments remain unmatched an error is declared.

   Argument matching is augmented by the functions `match.arg',
`match.call' and `match.fun'.  Access to the partial matching algorithm
used by R is via `pmatch'.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Argument evaluation,  Next: Scope,  Prev: Argument matching,  Up: Evaluation

4.3.3 Argument evaluation
-------------------------

One of the most important things to know about the evaluation of
arguments to a function is that supplied arguments and default arguments
are treated differently.  The supplied arguments to a function are
evaluated in the evaluation frame of the calling function.  The default
arguments to a function are evaluated in the evaluation frame of the
function.

   The semantics of invoking a function in R argument are
_call-by-value_.  In general, supplied arguments behave as if they are
local variables initialized with the value supplied and the name of the
corresponding formal argument.  Changing the value of a supplied
argument within a function will not affect the value of the variable in
the calling frame.

   R has a form of lazy evaluation of function arguments.  Arguments are
not evaluated until needed.  It is important to realize that in some
cases the argument will never be evaluated.  Thus, it is bad style to
use arguments to functions to cause side-effects.  While in *C* it is
common to use the form, `foo(x = y)' to invoke `foo' with the value of
`y' and simultaneously to assign the value of `y' to `x' this same
style should not be used in R. There is no guarantee that the argument
will ever be evaluated and hence the assignment may not take place.

   It is also worth noting that the effect of `foo(x <- y)' if the
argument is evaluated is to change the value of `x' in the calling environment
and not in the evaluation environment of `foo'.

   It is possible to access the actual (not default) expressions used as
arguments inside the function.  The mechanism is implemented via
promises.  When a function is being evaluated the actual expression
used as an argument is stored in the promise together with a pointer to
the environment the function was called from.  When (if) the argument
is evaluated the stored expression is evaluated in the environment that
the function was called from.  Since only a pointer to the environment
is used any changes made to that environment will be in effect during
this evaluation.  The resulting value is then also stored in a separate
spot in the promise.  Subsequent evaluations retrieve this stored value
(a second evaluation is not carried out).  Access to the unevaluated
expression is also available using `substitute'.

   When a function is called, each formal argument is assigned a
promise in the local environment of the call with the expression slot
containing the actual argument (if it exists) and the environment slot
containing the environment of the caller.  If no actual argument for a
formal argument is given in the call and there is a default expression,
it is similarly assigned to the expression slot of the formal argument,
but with the environment set to the local environment.

   The process of filling the value slot of a promise by evaluating the
contents of the expression slot in the promises environment is called
_forcing_ the promise.  A promise will only be forced once, the value
slot content being used directly later on.

   A promise is forced when its value is needed.  This usually happens
inside internal functions, but a promise can also be forced by direct
evaluation of the promise itself.  This is occasionally useful when a
default expression depends on the value of another formal argument or
other variable in the local environment.  This is seen in the following
example where the lone `label' ensures that the label is based on the
value of `x' before it is changed in the next line.

     function(x, label = deparse(x)) {
         label
         x <- x + 1
         print(label)
     }

   The expression slot of a promise can itself involve other promises.
This happens whenever an unevaluated argument is passed as an argument
to another function.  When forcing a promise, other promises in its
expression will also be forced recursively as they are evaluated.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Scope,  Prev: Argument evaluation,  Up: Evaluation

4.3.4 Scope
-----------

Scope or the scoping rules are simply the set of rules used by the evaluator
to find a value for a symbol.  Every computer language has a set of
such rules.  In R the rules are fairly simple but there do exist
mechanisms for subverting the usual, or default rules.

   R adheres to a set of rules that are called _lexical scope_.  This
means the variable bindings in effect at the time the expression was
created are used to provide values for any unbound symbols in the
expression.

   Most of the interesting properties of scope are involved with
evaluating functions and we concentrate on this issue.  A symbol can be
either bound or unbound.  All of the formal arguments to a function
provide bound symbols in the body of the function.  Any other symbols
in the body of the function are either local variables or unbound
variables.  A local variable is one that is defined within the
function.  Because R has no formal definition of variables, they are
simply used as needed, it can be difficult to determine whether a
variable is local or not.  Local variables must first be defined, this
is typically done by having them on the left-hand side of an assignment.

   During the evaluation process if an unbound symbol is detected then R
attempts to find a value for it.  The scoping rules determine how this
process proceeds.  In R the environment of the function is searched
first, then its enclosure and so on until the global environment is
reached.

   The global environment heads a search list of environments that are
searched sequentially for a matching symbol.  The value of the first
match is then used.

   When this set of rules is combined with the fact that functions can
be returned as values from other functions then some rather nice, but at
first glance peculiar, properties obtain.

   A simple example:

     f <- function() {
         y <- 10
         g <- function(x) x + y
         return(g)
     }
     h <- f()
     h(3)

   A rather interesting question is what happens when `h' is evaluated.
To describe this we need a bit more notation.  Within a function body
variables can be bound, local or unbound.  The bound variables are
those that match the formal arguments to the function.  The local
variables are those that were created or defined within the function
body.  The unbound variables are those that are neither local nor
bound.  When a function body is evaluated there is no problem
determining values for local variables or for bound variables.  Scoping
rules determine how the language will find values for the unbound
variables.

   When `h(3)' is evaluated we see that its body is that of `g'. Within
that body `x' is bound to the formal argument and `y' is unbound.  In a
language with lexical scope `x' will be associated with the value 3 and
`y' with the value 10 local to `f' so `h(3)' should return the value 13.
In R this is indeed what happens.

   In S, because of the different scoping rules one will get an error
indicating that `y' is not found, unless there is a variable `y' in
your workspace in which case its value will be used.

5 Object-oriented programming
*****************************

Object-oriented programming is a style of programming that has become
popular in recent years.  Much of the popularity comes from the fact
that it makes it easier to write and maintain complicated systems.  It
does this through several different mechanisms.

   Central to any object-oriented language are the concepts of class
and of methods.  A _class_ is a definition of an object.  Typically a
class contains several _slots_ that are used to hold class-specific
information.  An object in the language must be an instance of some
class.  Programming is based on objects or instances of classes.

   Computations are carried out via _methods_.  Methods are basically functions
that are specialized to carry out specific calculations on objects,
usually of a specific class.  This is what makes the language object
oriented.  In R, _generic functions_ are used to determine the
appropriate method.  The generic function is responsible for
determining the class of its argument(s) and uses that information to
select the appropriate method.

   Another feature of most object-oriented languages is the concept of
inheritance.  In most programming problems there are usually many
objects that are related to one another.  The programming is
considerably simplified if some components can be reused.

   If a class inherits from another class then generally it gets all the
slots in the parent class and can extend it by adding new slots.  On
method dispatching (via the generic functions) if a method for the class
does not exist then a method for the parent is sought.

   In this chapter we discuss how this general strategy has been
implemented in R and discuss some of the limitations within the current
design.  One of the advantages that most object systems impart is
greater consistency.  This is achieved via the rules that are checked
by the compiler or interpreter.  Unfortunately because of the way that
the object system is incorporated into R this advantage does not
obtain.  Users are cautioned to use the object system in a
straightforward manner.  While it is possible to perform some rather
interesting feats these tend to lead to obfuscated code and may depend
on implementation details that will not be carried forward.

   The greatest use of object oriented programming in R is through
`print' methods, `summary' methods and `plot' methods.  These methods
allow us to have one generic function call, `plot' say, that dispatches
on the type of its argument and calls a plotting function that is
specific to the data supplied.

   In order to make the concepts clear we will consider the
implementation of a small system designed to teach students about
probability.  In this system the objects are probability functions and
the methods we will consider are methods for finding moments and for
plotting.  Probabilities can always be represented in terms of the
cumulative distribution function but can often be represented in other
ways.  For example as a density, when it exists or as a moment
generating function when it exists.

5.1 Definition
==============

Rather than having a full-fledged object-oriented system R has a class
system and a mechanism for dispatching based on the class of an object.
The dispatch mechanism for interpreted code relies on four special
objects that are stored in the evaluation frame.  These special objects
are `.Generic', `.Class', `.Method' and `.Group'.  There is a separate
dispatch mechanism used for internal functions and types that will be
discussed elsewhere.

   The class system is facilitated through the `class' attribute.  This
attribute is a list of class names.  So to create an object of class
`"foo"' one simply attaches a class attribute with the string `"foo"'
in it.  Thus, virtually anything can be turned in to an object of class
`"foo"'.

   The object system makes use of _generic functions_ via two
dispatching functions, `UseMethod' and `NextMethod'.  The typical use
of the object system is to begin by calling a generic function.  This
is typically a very simple function and consists of a single line of
code.  The system function `mean' is just such a function,

     > mean
     function (x, ...)
     UseMethod("mean")

   When `mean' is called it can have any number of arguments but its
first argument is special and the class of that first argument is used
to determine which method should be called.  The variable `.Class' is
set to the class attribute of `x', `.Generic' is set to the string
`"mean"' and a search is made for the correct method to invoke.  The
class attributes of any other arguments to `mean' are ignored.

   Suppose that `x' had a class attribute that contained `"foo"' and
`"bar"', in that order.  Then R would first search for a function
called `mean.foo' and if it did not find one it would then search for a
function `mean.bar' and if that search was also unsuccessful then a
final search for `mean.default' would be made.  If the last search is
unsuccessful R reports an error.  It is a good idea to always write a
default method.  Note that the functions `mean.foo' etc. are referred
to, in this context, as methods.

   `NextMethod' provides another mechanism for dispatching.  A function
may have a call to `NextMethod' anywhere in it.  The determination of
which method should then be invoked is based primarily on the current
values of `.Class' and `.Generic'.  This is somewhat problematic since
the method is really an ordinary function and users may call it
directly.  If they do so then there will be no values for `.Generic' or
`.Class'.

   If a method is invoked directly and it contains a call to
`NextMethod' then the first argument to `NextMethod' is used to
determine the generic function.  An error is signalled if this argument
has not been supplied; it is therefore a good idea to always supply
this argument.

   In the case that a method is invoked directly the class attribute of
the first argument to the method is used as the value of `.Class'.

   Methods themselves employ `NextMethod' to provide a form of
inheritance.  Commonly a specific method performs a few operations to
set up the data and then it calls the next appropriate method through a
call to `NextMethod'.

   Consider the following simple example.  A point in two-dimensional
Euclidean space can be specified by its Cartesian (x-y) or polar
(r-theta) coordinates.  Hence, to store information about the location
of the point, we could define two classes, `"xypoint"' and
`"rthetapoint"'.  All the `xypoint' data structures are lists with an
x-component and a y-component.  All `rthetapoint' objects are lists
with an r-component and a theta-component.

   Now, suppose we want to get the x-position from either type of
object.  This can easily be achieved through generic functions.  We
define the generic function `xpos' as follows.

     xpos <- function(x, ...)
         UseMethod("xpos")

Now we can define methods:

     xpos.xypoint <- function(x) x$x
     xpos.rthetapoint <- function(x) x$r * cos(x$theta)

   The user simply calls the function `xpos' with either representation
as the argument.  The internal dispatching method finds the class of
the object and calls the appropriate methods.

   It is pretty easy to add other representations.  One need not write a
new generic function only the methods.  This makes it easy to add to
existing systems since the user is only responsible for dealing with the
new representation and not with any of the existing representations.

   The bulk of the uses of this methodology are to provided specialized
printing for objects of different types; there are about 40 methods for
`print'.

5.2 Inheritance
===============

The class attribute of an object can have several elements.  When a generic
function is called the first inheritance is mainly handled through
`NextMethod'.  `NextMethod' determines the method currently being
evaluated, finds the next class from th

5.3 Method dispatching
======================

Generic functions should consist of a single statement.  They should
usually be of the form `foo <- function(x, ...) UseMethod("foo", x)'.
When `UseMethod' is called, it determines the appropriate method and
then that method is invoked with the same arguments, in the same order
as the call to the generic, as if the call had been made directly to
the method.

   In order to determine the correct method the class attribute of the
first argument to the generic is obtained and used to find the correct
method.  The name of the generic function is combined with the first
element of the class attribute into the form, `GENERIC.CLASS' and a
function with that name is sought.  If the function is found then it is
used.  If no such function is found then the second element of the class
attribute is used, and so on until all the elements of the class
attribute have been exhausted.  If no method has been found at that
point then the method `GENERIC.DEFAULT' is used.  If the first argument
to the generic function has no class attribute then `GENERIC.DEFAULT'
is used.  Since the introduction of namespaces the methods may not be
accessible by their names (i.e. `get("GENERIC.CLASS")' may fail), but
they will be accessible by `getS3method("GENERIC","CLASS")'.

   Any object can have a `class' attribute.  This attribute can have
any number of elements.  Each of these is a string that defines a class.
When a generic function is invoked the class of its first argument is
examined.

5.4 UseMethod
=============

`UseMethod' is a special function and it behaves differently from other
function calls.  The syntax of a call to it is `UseMethod(GENERIC,
OBJECT)', where GENERIC is the name of the generic function, OBJECT is
the object used to determine which method should be chosen.
`UseMethod' can only be called from the body of a function.

   `UseMethod' changes the evaluation model in two ways.  First, when
it is invoked it determines the next method (function) to be called.  It
then invokes that function using the current evaluation environment;
this process will be described shortly.  The second way in which
`UseMethod' changes the evaluation environment is that it does not
return control to the calling function.  This means, that any
statements after a call to `UseMethod' are guaranteed not to be
executed.

   When `UseMethod' is invoked the generic function is the specified
value in the call to `UseMethod'.  The object to dispatch on is either
the supplied second argument or the first argument to the current
function.  The class of the argument is determined and the first element
of it is combined with the name of the generic to determine the
appropriate method.  So, if the generic had name `foo' and the class of
the object is `"bar"', then R will search for a method named `foo.bar'.
If no such method exists then the inheritance mechanism described above
is used to locate an appropriate method.

   Once a method has been determined R invokes it in a special way.
Rather than creating a new evaluation environment R uses the
environment of the current function call (the call to the generic).  Any assignments
or evaluations that were made before the call to `UseMethod' will be in
effect.  The arguments that were used in the call to the generic are
rematched to the formal arguments of the selected method.

   When the method is invoked it is called with arguments that are the
same in number and have the same names as in the call to the generic.
They are matched to the arguments of the method according to the
standard R rules for argument matching.  However the object, i.e. the
first argument has been evaluated.

   The call to `UseMethod' has the effect of placing some special
objects in the evaluation frame.  They are `.Class', `.Generic' and
`.Method'.  These special objects are used to by R to handle the method
dispatch and inheritance.  `.Class' is the class of the object,
`.Generic' is the name of the generic function and `.Method' is the
name of the method currently being invoked.  If the method was invoked
through one of the internal interfaces then there may also be an object
called `.Group'.  This will be described in Section *note Group
methods::.  After the initial call to `UseMethod' these special
variables, not the object itself, control the selection of subsequent
methods.

   The body of the method is then evaluated in the standard fashion.  In
particular variable look-up in the body follows the rules for the
method.  So if the method has an associated environment then that is
used.  In effect we have replaced the call to the generic by a call to
the method.  Any local assignments in the frame of the generic will be
carried forward into the call to the method.  Use of this _feature_ is
discouraged.  It is important to realize that control will never return
to the generic and hence any expressions after a call to `UseMethod'
will never be executed.

   Any arguments to the generic that were evaluated prior to the call to
`UseMethod' remain evaluated.

   The arguments in the call to the generic are rematched with the
arguments for the method using the standard argument matching mechanism.
The first argument, i.e. the object, will have been evaluated.

   If the first argument to `UseMethod' is not supplied it is assumed
to be the name of the current function.  If two arguments are supplied
to `UseMethod' then the first is the name of the method and the second
is assumed to be the object that will be dispatched on.  It is
evaluated so that the required method can be determined.  In this case
the first argument in the call to the generic is not evaluated and is
discarded.  There is no way to change the other arguments in the call to
the method these remain as they were in the call to the generic.  This
is in contrast to `NextMethod' where the arguments in the call to the
next method can be altered.

5.5 NextMethod
==============

`NextMethod' is used to provide a simple inheritance mechanism.

   Methods invoked as a result of a call to `NextMethod' behave as if
they had been invoked from the previous method.  The arguments to the
inherited method are in the same order and have the same names as the
call to the current method.  This means that they are the same as for
the call to the generic.  However, the expressions for the arguments are
the names of the corresponding formal arguments of the current method.
Thus the arguments will have values that correspond to their value at
the time NextMethod was invoked.

   Unevaluated arguments remain unevaluated.  Missing arguments remain
missing.

   The syntax for a call to `NextMethod' is `NextMethod(generic,
object, ...)'.  If the `generic' is not supplied the value of
`.Generic' is used.  If the `object' is not supplied the first argument
in the call to the current method is used.  Values in the `...'
argument are used to modify the arguments of the next method.

   It is important to realize that the choice of the next method
depends on the current values of `.Generic' and `.Class' and not on the
object.  So changing the object in a call to `NextMethod' affects the
arguments received by the next method but does not affect the choice of
the next method.

   Methods can be called directly.  If they are then there will be no
`.Generic', `.Class' or `.Method'.  In this case the `generic' argument
of `NextMethod' must be specified.  The value of `.Class' is taken to
be the class attribute of the object which is the first argument to the
current function.  The value of `.Method' is the name of the current
function.  These choices for default values ensure that the behaviour
of a method doesn't change depending on whether it is called directly
or via a call to a generic.

   An issue for discussion is the behaviour of the `...' argument to
`NextMethod'.  The White Book describes the behaviour as follows:

   - named arguments replace the corresponding arguments in the call to
 the current method.  Unnamed arguments go at the start of the argument
 list.

   What I would like to do is:

   -first do the argument matching for NextMethod;   -if the object or
generic are changed fine   -first if a named list element matches an
argument (named or not) the   list value replaces the argument value.
- the first unnamed list element

   Values for lookup:  Class: comes first from .Class, second from the
first argument to the  method and last from the object specified in the
call to NextMethod

   Generic: comes first from .Generic, if nothing then from the first
argument to the method and if it's still missing from the call to
NextMethod

   Method: this should just be the current function name.

5.6 Group methods
=================

For several types of internal functions R provides a dispatching
mechanism for operators.  This means that operators such as `==' or `<'
can have their behaviour modified for members of special classes.  The
functions and operators have been grouped into three categories and
group methods can be written for each of these categories.  There is
currently no mechanism to add groups.  It is possible to write methods
specific to any function within a group.

   The following table lists the functions for the different Groups.

`Math'
     abs, acos, acosh, asin, asinh, atan, atanh, ceiling, cos, cosh,
     cumsum, exp, floor, gamma, lgamma, log, log10, round, signif, sin,
     sinh, tan, tanh, trunc

`Summary'
     all, any, max, min, prod, range, sum

`Ops'
     `+', `-', `*', `/', `^', `<' , `>', `<=', `>=', `!=', `==', `%%',
     `%/%', `&', `|', `!'

   For operators in the Ops group a special method is invoked if the two
operands taken together suggest a single method.  Specifically, if both
operands correspond to the same method or if one operand corresponds to
a method that takes precedence over that of the other operand.  If they
do not suggest a single method then the default method is used.  Either
a group method or a class method dominates if the other operand has no
corresponding method.  A class method dominates a group method.

   When the group is Ops the special variable `.Method' is a string
vector with two elements.  The elements of `.Method' are set to the
name of the method if the corresponding argument is a member of the
class that was used to determine the method.  Otherwise the
corresponding element of `.Method' is set to the zero length string,
`""'.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Writing methods,  Prev: Group methods,  Up: Object-oriented programming

5.7 Writing methods
===================

Users can easily write their own methods and generic functions.  A generic
function is simply a function with a call to `UseMethod'.  A method is
simply a function that has been invoked via method dispatch.  This can
be as a result of a call to either `UseMethod' or `NextMethod'.

   It is worth remembering that methods can be called directly.  That
means that they can be entered without a call to `UseMethod' having been
made and hence the special variables `.Generic', `.Class' and `.Method'
will not have been instantiated.  In that case the default rules
detailed above will be used to determine these.

   The most common use of generic functions is to provide `print' and
`summary' methods for statistical objects, generally the output of some
model fitting process.  To do this, each model attaches a class
attribute to its output and then provides a special method that takes
that output and provides a nice readable version of it.  The user then
needs only remember that `print' or `summary' will provide nice output
for the results of any analysis.

6 Computing on the language
***************************

R belongs to a class of programming languages in which subroutines have
the ability to modify or construct other subroutines and evaluate the
result as an integral part of the language itself.  This is similar to
Lisp and Scheme and other languages of the "functional programming"
variety, but in contrast to FORTRAN and the ALGOL family.  The Lisp
family takes this feature to the extreme by the "everything is a list"
paradigm in which there is no distinction between programs and data.

   R presents a friendlier interface to programming than Lisp does, at
least to someone used to mathematical formulas and C-like control
structures, but the engine is really very Lisp-like.  R allows direct
access to parsed expressions and functions and allows you to alter and
subsequently execute them, or create entirely new functions from
scratch.

   There is a number of standard applications of this facility, such as
calculation of analytical derivatives of expressions, or the generation
of polynomial functions from a vector of coefficients.  However, there
are also uses that are much more fundamental to the workings of the
interpreted part of R.  Some of these are essential to the reuse of
functions as components in other functions, as the (admittedly not very
pretty) calls to `model.frame' that are constructed in several modeling
and plotting routines.  Other uses simply allow elegant interfaces to
useful functionality.  As an example, consider the `curve' function,
which allows you to draw the graph of a function given as an expression
like `sin(x)' or the facilities for plotting mathematical expressions.

   In this chapter, we give an introduction to the set of facilities
that are available for computing on the language.

6.1 Direct manipulation of language objects
===========================================

There are three kinds of language objects that are available for
modification, calls, expressions, and functions.  At this point, we
shall concentrate on the call objects.  These are sometimes referred to
as "unevaluated expressions", although this terminology is somewhat
confusing.  The most direct method of obtaining a call object is to use
`quote' with an expression argument, e.g.,

     > e1 <- quote(2 + 2)
     > e2 <- quote(plot(x, y))

   The arguments are not evaluated, the result is simply the parsed
argument.  The objects `e1' and `e2' may be evaluated later using
`eval', or simply manipulated as data.  It is perhaps most immediately
obvious why the `e2' object has mode `"call"', since it involves a call
to the `plot' function with some arguments.  However, `e1' actually has
exactly the same structure as a call to the binary operator `+' with
two arguments, a fact that gets clearly displayed by the following

     > quote("+"(2, 2))
     2 + 2

   The components of a call object are accessed using a list-like
syntax, and may in fact be converted to and from lists using `as.list'
and `as.call'

     > e2[[1]]
     plot
     > e2[[2]]
     x
     > e2[[3]]
     y

   When keyword argument matching is used, the keywords can be used as
list tags:

     > e3 <- quote(plot(x = age, y = weight))
     > e3$x
     age
     > e3$y
     weight

   All the components of the call object have mode `"name"' in the
preceding examples.  This is true for identifiers in calls, but the
components of a call can also be constants--which can be of any type,
although the first component had better be a function if the call is to
be evaluated successfully--or other call objects, corresponding to
subexpressions.  Objects of mode name can be constructed from character
strings using `as.name', so one might modify the `e2' object as follows

     > e2[[1]] <- as.name("+")
     > e2
     x + y

   To illustrate the fact that subexpressions are simply components that
are themselves calls, consider

     > e1[[2]] <- e2
     > e1
     x + y + 2

   All grouping parentheses in input are preserved in parsed
expressions.  They are represented as a function call with one
argument, so that `4 - (2 - 2)' becomes `"-"(4, "(" ("-"(2, 2)))' in
prefix notation.  In evaluations, the `(' operator just returns its
argument.

   This is a bit unfortunate, but it is not easy to write a parser/deparser
combination that both preserves user input, stores it in minimal form
and ensures that parsing a deparsed expression gives the same expression
back.

   As it happens, R's parser is not perfectly invertible, nor is its
deparser, as the following examples show

     > deparse(quote(c(1, 2)))
     [1] "c(1, 2)"
     > deparse(1:2)
     [1] "c(1, 2)"
     > quote("-"(2, 2))
     2 - 2
     > quote(2 - 2)
     2 - 2

Deparsed expressions should, however, evaluate to an equivalent value
to the original expression (up to rounding error).

6.2 Substitutions
=================

It is in fact not often that one wants to modify the innards of an
expression like in the previous section.  More frequently, one wants to
simply get at an expression in order to deparse it and use it for
labeling plots, for instance.  An example of this is seen at the
beginning of `plot.default': 

     xlabel <- if (!missing(x))
         deparse(substitute(x))

This causes the variable or expression given as the `x' argument to
`plot' to be used for labeling the x-axis later on.

   The function used to achieve this is `substitute' which takes the
expression `x' and substitutes the expression that was passed through
the formal argument `x'.  Notice that for this to happen, `x' must
carry information about the expression that creates its value.  This is
related to the lazy evaluation scheme of R (*note Promise objects::).
A formal argument is really a _promise_, an object with three slots,
one for the expression that defines it, one for the environment in
which to evaluate that expression, and one for the value of that
expression once evaluated. `substitute' will recognize a promise
variable and substitute the value of its expression slot.  If
`substitute' is invoked inside a function, the local variables of the
function are also subject to substitution.

   The argument to `substitute' does not have to be a simple
identifier, it can be an expression involving several variables and
substitution will occur for each of these.  Also, `substitute' has an
additional argument which can be an environment or a list in which the
variables are looked up.  For example:

     > substitute(a + b, list(a = 1, b = quote(x)))
     1 + x

   Notice that quoting was necessary to substitute the `x'.  This kind
of construction comes in handy in connection with the facilities for
putting math expression in graphs, as the following case shows

     > plot(0)
     > for (i in 1:4)
     +   text(1, 0.2 * i,
     +        substitute(x[ix] == y, list(ix = i, y = pnorm(i))))

   It is important to realize that the substitutions are purely lexical;
there is no checking that the resulting call objects make sense if they
are evaluated.  `substitute(x <- x + 1, list(x = 2))' will happily
return `2 <- 2 + 1'.  However, some parts of R make up their own rules
for what makes sense and what does not and might actually have a use
for such ill-formed expressions.  For example, using the "math in
graphs" feature often involves constructions that are syntactically
correct, but which would be meaningless to evaluate, like `{}>=40*"
years"'.

   Substitute will not evaluate its first argument.  This leads to the
puzzle of how to do substitutions on an object that is contained in a
variable.  The solution is to use `substitute' once more, like this

     > expr <- quote(x + y)
     > substitute(substitute(e, list(x = 3)), list(e = expr))
     substitute(x + y, list(x = 3))
     > eval(substitute(substitute(e, list(x = 3)), list(e = expr)))
     3 + y

   The exact rules for substitutions are as follows:  Each symbol in the parse
tree for the first is matched against the second argument, which can be
a tagged list or an environment frame.  If it is a simple local object,
its value is inserted, _except_ if matching against the global
environment.  If it is a promise (usually a function argument), the
promise expression is substituted.  If the symbol is not matched, it is
left untouched.  The special exception for substituting at the top
level is admittedly peculiar.  It has been inherited from S and the
rationale is most likely that there is no control over which variables
might be bound at that level so that it would be better to just make
substitute act as `quote'.

   The rule of promise substitution is slightly different from that of
S if the local variable is modified before `substitute' is used.  R
will then use the new value of the variable, whereas S will
unconditionally use the argument expression--unless it was a constant,
which has the curious consequence that `f((1))' may be very different
from `f(1)' in S.  The R rule is considerably cleaner, although it does
have consequences in connection with lazy evaluation that comes as a
surprise to some.  Consider

     logplot <- function(y, ylab = deparse(substitute(y))) {
         y <- log(y)
         plot(y, ylab = ylab)
     }

   This looks straightforward, but one will discover that the y label
becomes an ugly `c(...)' expression.  It happens because the rules of
lazy evaluation causes the evaluation of the `ylab' expression to
happen _after_ `y' has been modified.  The solution is to force `ylab'
to be evaluated first, i.e.,

     logplot <- function(y, ylab = deparse(substitute(y))) {
         ylab
         y <- log(y)
         plot(y, ylab = ylab)
     }

   Notice that one should not use `eval(ylab)' in this situation.  If
`ylab' is a language or expression object, then that would cause the
object to be evaluated as well, which would not at all be desirable if
a math expression like `quote(log[e](y))' was being passed.

   A variant on `substitute' is `bquote', which is used to replace some
subexpressions with their values.  The example from above
     > plot(0)
     > for (i in 1:4)
     +   text(1, 0.2 * i,
     +        substitute(x[ix] == y, list(ix = i, y = pnorm(i))))
   could be written more compactly as
     plot(0)
     for(i in 1:4)
        text(1, 0.2*i, bquote( x[.(i)] == .(pnorm(i)) ))

   The expression is quoted except for the contents of `.()'
subexpressions, which are replaced with their values. There is an
optional argument to compute the values in a different environment. The
syntax for `bquote' is borrowed from the LISP backquote macro.

6.3 More on evaluation
======================

The `eval' function was introduced earlier in this chapter as a means
of evaluating call objects.  However, this is not the full story.  It
is also possible to specify the environment in which the evaluation is
to take place. By default this is the evaluation frame from which
`eval' is called, but quite frequently it needs to be set to something
else.  

   Very often, the relevant evaluation frame is that of the parent of
the current frame (cf. ???).  In particular, when the object to evaluate
is the result of a `substitute' operation of the function arguments, it
will contain variables that make sense to the caller only (notice that
there is no reason to expect that the variables of the caller are in the lexical
scope of the callee).  Since evaluation in the parent frame occurs
frequently, an `eval.parent' function exists as a shorthand for
`eval(expr, sys.frame(sys.parent()))'.

   Another case that occurs frequently is evaluation in a list or a data
frame.  For instance, this happens in connection with the `model.frame'
function when a `data' argument is given.  Generally, the terms of the
model formula need to be evaluated in `data', but they may occasionally
also contain references to items in the caller of `model.frame'.  This
is sometimes useful in connection with simulation studies.  So for this
purpose one needs not only to evaluate an expression in a list, but
also to specify an enclosure into which the search continues if the
variable is not in the list.  Hence, the call has the form

     eval(expr, data, sys.frame(sys.parent()))

   Notice that evaluation in a given environment may actually change
that environment, most obviously in cases involving the assignment
operator, such as

     eval(quote(total <- 0), environment(robert$balance)) # rob Rob

This is also true when evaluating in lists, but the original list does
not change because one is really working on a copy.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Evaluation of expression objects,  Next: Manipulation of function calls,  Prev: More on evaluation,  Up: Computing on the language

6.4 Evaluation of expression objects
====================================

Objects of mode `"expression"' are defined in *note Expression
objects::.  They are very similar to lists of call objects.

     > ex <- expression(2 + 2, 3 + 4)
     > ex[[1]]
     2 + 2
     > ex[[2]]
     3 + 4
     > eval(ex)
     [1] 7

   Notice that evaluating an expression object evaluates each call in
turn, but the final value is that of the last call.  In this respect it
behaves almost identically to the compound language object `quote({2 +
2; 3 + 4})'.  However, there is a subtle difference: Call objects are
indistinguishable from subexpressions in a parse tree.  This means that
they are automatically evaluated in the same way a subexpression would
be.  Expression objects can be recognized during evaluation and in a
sense retain their quotedness.  The evaluator will not evaluate an
expression object recursively, only when it is passed directly to
`eval' function as above.  The difference can be seen like this:

     > eval(substitute(mode(x), list(x = quote(2 + 2))))
     [1] "numeric"
     > eval(substitute(mode(x), list(x = expression(2 + 2))))
     [1] "expression"

   The deparser represents an expression object by the call that
creates it.  This is similar to the way it handles numerical vectors
and several other objects that do not have a specific external
representation.  However, it does lead to the following bit of
confusion:

     > e <- quote(expression(2 + 2))
     > e
     expression(2 + 2)
     > mode(e)
     [1] "call"
     > ee <- expression(2 + 2)
     > ee
     expression(2 + 2)
     > mode(ee)
     [1] "expression"

I.e., `e' and `ee' look identical when printed, but one is a call that
generates an expression object and the other is the object itself.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Manipulation of function calls,  Next: Manipulation of functions,  Prev: Evaluation of expression objects,  Up: Computing on the language

6.5 Manipulation of function calls
==================================

It is possible for a function to find out how it has been called by
looking at the result of `sys.call' as in the following example of a
function that simply returns its own call:

     > f <- function(x, y, ...) sys.call()
     > f(y = 1, 2, z = 3, 4)
     f(y = 1, 2, z = 3, 4)

   However, this is not really useful except for debugging because it
requires the function to keep track of argument matching in order to
interpret the call.  For instance, it must be able to see that the 2nd
actual argument gets matched to the first formal one (`x' in the above
example).

   More often one requires the call with all actual arguments bound to
the corresponding formals.  To this end, the function `match.call' is
used.  Here's a variant of the preceding example, a function that
returns its own call with arguments matched

     > f <- function(x, y, ...) match.call()
     > f(y = 1, 2, z = 3, 4)
     f(x = 2, y = 1, z = 3, 4)

   Notice that the second argument now gets matched to `x' and appears
in the corresponding position in the result.

   The primary use of this technique is to call another function with
the same arguments, possibly deleting some and adding others.  A typical
application is seen at the start of the `lm' function:

         mf <- cl <- match.call()
         mf$singular.ok <- mf$model <- mf$method <- NULL
         mf$x <- mf$y <- mf$qr <- mf$contrasts <- NULL
         mf$drop.unused.levels <- TRUE
         mf[[1]] <- as.name("model.frame")
         mf <- eval(mf, sys.frame(sys.parent()))

   Notice that the resulting call is evaluated in the parent frame, in
which one can be certain that the involved expressions make sense.  The
call can be treated as a list object where the first element is the name
of the function and the remaining elements are the actual argument
expressions, with the corresponding formal argument names as tags.
Thus, the technique to eliminate undesired arguments is to assign
`NULL', as seen in lines 2 and 3, and to add an argument one uses
tagged list assignment (here to pass `drop.unused.levels = TRUE') as in
line 4.  To change the name of the function called, assign to the first
element of the list and make sure that the value is a name, either
using the `as.name("model.frame")' construction here or
`quote(model.frame)'.

   The `match.call' function has an `expand.dots' argument which is a
switch which if set to `FALSE' lets all `...' arguments be collected as
a single argument with the tag `...'.  

     > f <- function(x, y, ...) match.call(expand.dots = FALSE)
     > f(y = 1, 2, z = 3, 4)
     f(x = 2, y = 1, ... = list(z = 3, 4))

   The `...' argument is a list (a pairlist to be precise), not a call
to `list' like it is in S:

     > e1 <- f(y = 1, 2, z = 3, 4)$...
     > e1
     $z
     [1] 3

     [[2]]
     [1] 4

   One reason for using this form of `match.call' is simply to get rid
of any `...' arguments in order not to be passing unspecified arguments
on to functions that may not know them.  Here's an example paraphrased
from `plot.formula':

     m <- match.call(expand.dots = FALSE)
     m$... <- NULL
     m[[1]] <- "model.frame"

   A more elaborate application is in `update.default' where a set of
optional extra arguments can add to, replace, or cancel those of the
original call:

     extras <- match.call(expand.dots = FALSE)$...
     if (length(extras) > 0) {
         existing <- !is.na(match(names(extras), names(call)))
         for (a in names(extras)[existing]) call[[a]] <- extras[[a]]
         if (any(!existing)) {
             call <- c(as.list(call), extras[!existing])
             call <- as.call(call)
         }
     }

   Notice that care is taken to modify existing arguments individually
in case `extras[[a]] == NULL'.  Concatenation does not work on call
objects without the coercion as shown; this is arguably a bug.

   Two further functions exist for the construction of function calls,
namely `call' and `do.call'.

   The function `call' allows creation of a call object from the
function name and the list of arguments

     > x <- 10.5
     > call("round", x)
     round(10.5)

   As seen, the value of `x' rather than the symbol is inserted in the
call, so it is distinctly different from `round(x)'.  The form is used
rather rarely, but is occasionally useful where the name of a function
is available as a character variable.

   The function `do.call' is related, but evaluates the call immediately
and takes the arguments from an object of mode `"list"' containing all
the arguments.  A natural use of this is when one wants to apply a
function like `cbind' to all elements of a list or data frame.  

     is.na.data.frame <- function (x) {
         y <- do.call("cbind", lapply(x, "is.na"))
         rownames(y) <- row.names(x)
         y
     }

   Other uses include variations over constructions like `do.call("f",
list(...))'.  However, one should be aware that this involves evaluation
of the arguments before the actual function call, which may defeat
aspects of lazy evaluation and argument substitution in the function
itself.  A similar remark applies to the `call' function.

6.6 Manipulation of functions
=============================

It is often useful to be able to manipulate the components of a function
or closure.  R provides a set of interface functions for this purpose.

`body'
     Returns the expression that is the body of the function.

`formals'
     Returns a list of the formal arguments to the function.  This is a
     `pairlist'.

`environment'
     Returns the environment associated with the function.

`body<-'
     This sets the body of the function to the supplied expression.

`formals<-'
     Sets the formal arguments of the function to the supplied list.

`environment<-'
     Sets the environment of the function to the specified environment.

   It is also possible to alter the bindings of different variables in
the environment of the function, using code along the lines of `evalq(x
<- 5, environment(f))'.

   It is also possible to convert a function to a list using `as.list'.
The result is the concatenation of the list of formal arguments with
the function body.  Conversely such a list can be converted to a
function using `as.function'.  This functionality is mainly included
for S compatibility.  Notice that environment information is lost when
`as.list' is used, whereas `as.function' has an argument that allows
the environment to be set.

File: R-lang.info,  Node: Operating system access,  Next: Foreign language interfaces,  Prev: System and foreign language interfaces,  Up: System and foreign language interfaces

7.1 Operating system access
===========================

Access to the operating system shell is via the R function `system'.  The
details will differ by platform (see the on-line help), and about all
that can safely be assumed is that the first argument will be a string
`command' that will be passed for execution (not necessarily by a
shell) and the second argument will be `internal' which if true will
collect the output of the command into an R character vector.

   The functions `system.time' and `proc.time' are available for timing
(although the information available may be limited on non-Unix-like
platforms).

   Information from the operating system environment can be accessed
and manipulated with

     `Sys.getenv'         OS environment variables
     `Sys.putenv'         
     `Sys.getlocale'      System locale
     `Sys.putlocale'      
     `Sys.localeconv'     
     `Sys.time'           Current time
     `Sys.timezone'       Time zone

   A uniform set of file access functions is provided on all platforms:

     `file.access'        Ascertain File Accessibility
     `file.append'        Concatenate files
     `file.choose'        Prompt user for file name
     `file.copy'          Copy files
     `file.create'        Create or truncate a files
     `file.exists'        Test for existence
     `file.info'          Miscellaneous file information
     `file.remove'        remove files
     `file.rename'        rename files
     `file.show'          Display a text file
     `unlink'             Remove files or directories.

   There are also functions for manipulating file names and paths in a
platform-independent way.

     `basename'           File name without directory
     `dirname'            Directory name
     `file.path'          Construct path to file
     `path.expand'        Expand `~' in Unix path

7.2 Foreign language interfaces
===============================

See *note System and foreign language interfaces: (R-exts)System and
foreign language interfaces. for the details of adding functionality to
R via compiled code.

   Functions `.C' and `.Fortran' provide a standard interface to
compiled code that has been linked into R, either at build time or via
`dyn.load'.  They are primarily intended for compiled *C* and FORTRAN
code respectively, but the `.C' function can be used with other
languages which can generate C interfaces, for example C++.

   Functions `.Call' and `.External' provide interfaces which allow
compiled code (primarily compiled *C* code) to manipulate R objects.

7.3 .Internal and .Primitive

compiled into R at build time.  *Note .Internal vs .Primitive:

8 Exception handling
********************

The exception handling facilities in R are provided through two
mechanisms.  Functions such as `stop' or `warning' can be called
directly or options such as `"warn"' can be used to control the
handling of problems.

* Menu:

* stop::
* warning::
* on.exit::
* Error options::


File: R-lang.info,  Node: stop,  Next: warning,  Prev: Exception handling,  Up: Exception handling

8.1 stop
========

A call to `stop' halts the evaluation of the current expression, prints
the message argument and returns execution to top-level.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: warning,  Next: on.exit,  Prev: stop,  Up: Exception handling

8.2 warning
===========

The function `warning' takes a single argument that is a character
string.  The behaviour of a call to `warning' depends on the value of
the option `"warn"'.  If `"warn"' is negative warnings are ignored.  If
it is zero, they are stored and printed after the top-level function
has completed.  If it is one, they are printed as they occur and if it
is 2 (or larger) warnings are turned into errors.

   If `"warn"' is zero (the default), a variable `last.warning' is
created and the messages associated with each call to `warning' are
stored, sequentially, in this vector.  If there are fewer than 10
warnings they are printed after the function has finished evaluating.
If there are more than 10 then a message indicating how many warnings
occurred is printed.  In either case `last.warning' contains the vector
of messages, and `warnings' provides a way to access and print it.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: on.exit,  Next: Error options,  Prev: warning,  Up: Exception handling

8.3 on.exit
===========

A function can insert a call to `on.exit' at any point in the body of a
function.  The effect of a call to `on.exit' is to store the value of
the body so that it will be executed when the function exits.  This
allows the function to change some system parameters and to ensure that
they are reset to appropriate values when the function is finished.
The `on.exit' is guaranteed to be executed when the function exits
either directly or as the result of a warning.

   An error in the evaluation of the `on.exit' code causes an immediate
jump to top-level without further processing of the `on.exit' code.

   `on.exit' takes a single argument which is an expression to be
evaluated when the function is exited.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Error options,  Prev: on.exit,  Up: Exception handling

8.4 Error options
=================

There are a number of `options' variables that can be used to control
how R handles errors and warnings.  The are listed in the table below.

`warn'
     Controls the printing of warnings.

`warning.expression'
     Sets an expression that is to be evaluated when a warning occurs.
     The normal printing of warnings is suppressed if this option is
     set.

`error'
     Installs an expression that will be evaluated when an error occurs.
     The normal printing of error messages and warning messages
     precedes the evaluation of the expression.

   Expressions installed by `options("error")' are evaluated before
calls to `on.exit' are carried out.

   One can use `options(error = expression(q("yes")))' to get R to quit
when an error has been signalled.  In this case an error will cause R
to shut down and the global environment will be saved.

9 Debugging
***********

Debugging code has always been a bit of an art.  R provides several
tools that help users find problems in their code.  These tools halt
execution at particular points in the code and the current state of the
computation can be inspected.

   Most debugging takes place either through calls to `browser' or
`debug'.  Both of these functions rely on the same internal mechanism
and both provide the user with a special prompt.  Any command can be
typed at the prompt.  The evaluation environment for the command is the
currently active environment.  This allows you to examine the current
state of any variables etc.

   There are five special commands that R interprets differently.  They
are,

`<RET>'
     Go to the next statement if the function is being debugged.
     Continue execution if the browser was invoked.

`c'
`cont'
     Continue the execution.

`n'
     Execute the next statement in the function.  This works from the
     browser as well.

`where'
     Show the call stack

`Q'
     Halt execution and jump to the top-level immediately.

   If there is a local variable with the same name as one of the special
commands listed above then its value can be accessed by using `get'.  A
call to `get' with the name in quotes will retrieve the value in the
current environment.

   The debugger provides access only to interpreted expressions.  If a
function calls a foreign language (such as *C*) then no access to the
statements in that language is provided.  Execution will halt on the
next statement that is evaluated in R. A symbolic debugger such as
`gdb' can be used to debug compiled code.

* Menu:

* browser::
* debug/undebug::
* trace/untrace::
* traceback::


File: R-lang.info,  Node: browser,  Next: debug/undebug,  Prev: Debugging,  Up: Debugging

9.1 browser
===========

A call to the function `browser' causes R to halt execution at that
point and to provide the user with a special prompt.  Arguments to
`browser' are ignored.

     > foo <- function(s) {
     + c <- 3
     + browser()
     + }
     > foo(4)
     Called from: foo(4)

     [1] 3
     Browse[1]>


File: R-lang.info,  Node: debug/undebug,  Next: trace/untrace,  Prev: browser,  Up: Debugging

9.2 debug/undebug
=================

The debugger can be invoked on any function by using the command
`debug(FUN)'.  Subsequently, each time that function is evaluated the
debugger is invoked.  The debugger allows you to control the evaluation
of the statements in the body of the function.  Before each statement
is executed the statement is printed out and a special prompt provided.
Any command can be given, those in the table above have special meaning.

   Debugging is turned off by a call to `undebug' with the function as
an argument.

     > debug(mean.default)
     > mean(1:10)
     debugging in: mean.default(1:10)
     debug: {
         if (na.rm)
             x <- x[!is.na(x)]
         trim <- trim[1]
         n <- length(c(x, recursive = TRUE))
         if (trim > 0) {
             if (trim >= 0.5)
                 return(median(x, na.rm = FALSE))
             lo <- floor(n * trim) + 1
             hi <- n + 1 - lo
             x <- sort(x, partial = unique(c(lo, hi)))[lo:hi]
             n <- hi - lo + 1
         }
         sum(x)/n
     }
     Browse[1]>
     debug: if (na.rm) x <- x[!is.na(x)]
     Browse[1]>
     debug: trim <- trim[1]
     Browse[1]>
     debug: n <- length(c(x, recursive = TRUE))
     Browse[1]> c

File: R-lang.info,  Node: trace/untrace,  Next: traceback,  Prev: debug/undebug,  Up: Debugging

9.3 trace/untrace
=================

Another way of monitoring the behaviour of R is through the `trace'
mechanism.  `trace' is called with a single argument that is the name
of the function you want to trace.  The name does not need to be quoted
but for some functions you will need to quote the name in order to
avoid a syntax error.

   When `trace' has been invoked on a function then every time that
function is evaluated the call to it is printed out.  This mechanism is
removed by calling `untrace' with the function as an argument.

     > trace("[<-")
     > x <- 1:10
     > x[3] <- 4
     trace: "[<-"(*tmp*, 3, value = 4)


File: R-lang.info,  Node: traceback,  Prev: trace/untrace,  Up: Debugging

9.4 traceback
=============

When an error has caused a jump to top-level a special variable called
`.Traceback' is placed into the base environment.  `.Traceback' is a
character vector with one entry for each function call that was active
at the time the error occurred.  An examination of `.Traceback' can be
carried out by a call to `traceback'.

10 Parser
*********

The parser is what converts the textual representation of R code into
an internal form which may then be passed to the R evaluator which
causes the specified instructions to be carried out.  The internal form
is itself an R object and can be saved and otherwise manipulated within
the R system.

File: R-lang.info,  Node: Modes of parsing,  Next: Internal representation,  Prev: The parsing process,  Up: The parsing process

10.1.1 Modes of parsing
-----------------------

Parsing in R occurs in three different variants:

   * The read-eval-print loop

   * Parsing of text files

   * Parsing of character strings

   The read-eval-print loop forms the basic command line interface to R.
Textual input is read until a complete R expression is available.
Expressions may be split over several input lines.  The primary prompt
(by default `> ') indicates that the parser is ready for a new
expression, and a continuation prompt (by default `+ ') indicates that
the parser expects the remainder of an incomplete expression.  The
expression is converted to internal form during input and the parsed
expression is passed to the evaluator and the result is printed (unless
specifically made invisible).  If the parser finds itself in a state
which is incompatible with the language syntax, a "Syntax Error" is
flagged and the parser resets itself and resumes input at the beginning
of the next input line.

   Text files can be parsed using the `parse' function.  In particular,
this is done during execution of the `source' function, which allows
commands to be stored in an external file and executed as if they had
been typed at the keyboard.  Note, though, that the entire file is
parsed and syntax checked before any evaluation takes place.

   Character strings, or vectors thereof, can be parsed using the
`text=' argument to `parse'.  The strings are treated exactly as if
they were the lines of an input file.

10.1.2 Internal representation
------------------------------

Parsed expressions are stored in an R object containing the parse tree.
A fuller description of such objects can be found in *note Language
objects:: and *note Expression objects::.  Briefly, every elementary R
expression is stored in function call form, as a list with the first
element containing the function name and the remainder containing the
arguments, which may in turn be further R expressions.  The list
elements can be named, corresponding to tagged matching of formal and
actual arguments.  Note that _all_ R syntax elements are treated in
this way, e.g. the assignment `x <- 1' is encoded as `"<-"(x, 1)'.

10.1.3 Deparsing
----------------

Any R object can be converted to an R expression using `deparse'.  This
is frequently used in connection with output of results, e.g. for
labeling plots.  Notice that only objects of mode `"expression"' can be
expected to be unchanged by reparsing the output of deparsing.  For
instance, the numeric vector `1:5' will deparse as `"c(1, 2, 3, 4,
5)"', which will reparse as a call to the function `c'.  As far as
possible, evaluating the deparsed and reparsed expression gives the
same result as evaluating the original, but there are a couple of
awkward exceptions, mostly involving expressions that weren't generated
from a textual representation in the first place.

10.2 Comments
=============

Comments in R are ignored by the parser.  Any text from a `#' character
to the end of the line is taken to be a comment, unless the `#'
character is inside a quoted string. For example,

     > x <- 1  # This is a comment...
     > y <- "  #... but this is not."

10.3 Tokens
===========

Tokens are the elementary building blocks of a programming language.
They are recognised during _lexical analysis_ which (conceptually, at
least) takes place prior to the syntactic analysis performed by the
parser itself.

10.3.1 Constants
----------------

There are five types of constants: integer, logical, numeric, complex
and string.

   In addition, there are four special constants, `NULL', `NA', `Inf',
and `NaN'.

   `NULL' is used to indicate the empty object.  `NA' is used for
absent ("Not Available") data values.  `Inf' denotes infinity and `NaN'
is not-a-number in the IEEE floating point calculus (results of the
operations respectively 1/0 and 0/0, for instance).

   Logical constants are either `TRUE' or `FALSE'.

   Numeric constants follow a similar syntax to that of the *C*
language.  They consist of an integer part consisting of zero or more
digits, followed optionally by `.' and a fractional part of zero or more
digits optionally followed by an exponent part consisting of an `E' or
an `e', an optional sign and a string of one or more digits.  Either
the fractional or the decimal part can be empty, but not both at once.

     Valid numeric constants: 1 10 0.1 .2 1e-7 1.2e+7

   Numeric constants can also be hexadecimal, starting with `0x' or
`0x' followed by zero or more digits, `a-f' or `A-F'.

   There is now a separate class of integer constants.  They are created
by using the qualifier `L' at the end of the number.  For example,
`123L' gives an integer value rather than a numeric value.  The suffix
`L' can be used to qualify any non-complex number with the intent of
creating an integer.  So it can be used with numbers given by
hexadecimal or scientific notation. However, if the value is not a
valid integer, a warning is emitted and the numeric value created.  The
following shows examples of valid integer constants, values which will
generate a warning and give numeric constants and syntax errors.

     Valid integer constants:  1L, 0x10L, 1000000L, 1e6L
     Valid numeric constants:  1.1L, 1e-3L
     Syntax error:  12iL

   A warning is emitted for values that contain an unnecessary decimal
point, e.g. `1.L'.

   Note also that a preceding sign (`+' or `-') is treated as a unary
operator, not as part of the constant.

   Up-to-date information on the currently accepted formats can be
found by `?NumericConstants'.

   Complex constants have the form of a decimal numeric constant
followed by `i'.  Notice that only purely imaginary numbers are actual
constants, other complex numbers are parsed a unary or binary operations
on numeric and imaginary numbers.

     Valid complex constants: 2i 4.1i 1e-2i

   String constants are delimited by a pair of single (`'') or double
(`"') quotes and can contain all other printable characters.  Quotes
and other special characters within strings are specified using _escape
sequences_:

`\''
     single quote

`\"'
     double quote

`\n'
     newline

`\r'
     carriage return

`\t'
     tab character

`\b'
     backspace

`\a'
     bell

`\f'
     form feed

`\v'
     vertical tab

`\\'
     backslash itself

`\NNN'
     character with given octal code - sequences of one, two or three
     digits in the range `0 ... 7' are accepted.

`\xNN'
     character with given hex code - sequences of one or two hex digits
     (with entries `0 ... 9 A ... F a ... f').

`\uNNNN \u{NNNN}'
     (where multibyte locales are supported, otherwise an error).
     Unicode character with given hex code - sequences of up to four hex
     digits. The character needs to be valid in the current locale.

`\UNNNNNNNN \U{NNNNNNNN}'
     (where multibyte locales are supported and not on Windows,
     otherwise an error).  Unicode character with given hex code -
     sequences of up to eight hex digits.

A single quote may also be embedded directly in a double-quote delimited
string and vice versa.

   As from R 2.8.0, a `nul' (`\0') is not allowed in a character
string, so using `\0' in a string constant terminates the constant
(usually with a warning): further characters up to the closing quote are
scanned but ignored.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Identifiers,  Next: Reserved words,  Prev: Literal constants,  Up: Tokens

10.3.2 Identifiers
------------------

Identifiers consist of a sequence of letters, digits, the period (`.')
and the underscore.  They must not start with a digit nor underscore,
nor with a period followed by a digit.

   The definition of a letter depends on the current locale: the precise
set of characters allowed is given by the C expression `(isalnum(c) ||
c == '.' || c == '_')' and will include accented letters in many
Western European locales.

   Notice that identifiers starting with a period are not by default
listed by the `ls' function and that `...' and `..1', `..2', etc. are
special.

   Notice also that objects can have names that are not identifiers.
These are generally accessed via `get' and `assign', although they can
also be represented by text strings in some limited circumstances when
there is no ambiguity (e.g. `"x" <- 1'). As `get' and `assign' are not
restricted to names that are identifiers they do not recognise
subscripting operators or replacement functions. The following pairs
are _not_ equivalent 

     `x$a<-1'         `assign("x$a",1)'
     `x[[1]]'         `get("x[[1]]")'
     `names(x)<-nm'   `assign("names(x)",nm)'

10.3.3 Reserved words
---------------------

The following identifiers have a special meaning and cannot be used for
object names

     if else repeat while function for in next break
     TRUE FALSE NULL Inf NaN
     NA NA_integer_ NA_real_ NA_complex_ NA_character_
     ... ..1 ..2 etc.

10.3.4 Special operators
------------------------

R allows user-defined infix operators.  These have the form of a string
of characters delimited by the `%' character.  The string can contain
any printable character except `%'.  The escape sequences for strings
do not apply here.

   Note that the following operators are predefined

     %% %*% %/% %in% %o% %x%


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Separators,  Next: Operator tokens,  Prev: Special operators,  Up: Tokens

10.3.5 Separators
-----------------

Although not strictly tokens, stretches of whitespace characters
(spaces, tabs and formfeeds, on Windows and UTF-8 locales other Unicode
whitespace characters(1)) serve to delimit tokens in case of ambiguity,
(compare `x<-5' and `x < -5').

   Newlines have a function which is a combination of token separator
and expression terminator.  If an expression can terminate at the end of
the line the parser will assume it does so, otherwise the newline is
treated as whitespace.  Semicolons (`;') may be used to separate
elementary expressions on the same line.

   Special rules apply to the `else' keyword: inside a compound
expression, a newline before `else' is discarded, whereas at the
outermost level, the newline terminates the `if' construction and a
subsequent `else' causes a syntax error.  This somewhat anomalous
behaviour occurs because R should be usable in interactive mode and
then it must decide whether the input expression is complete,
incomplete, or invalid as soon as the user presses <RET>.

   The comma (`,') is used to separate function arguments and multiple
indices.

10.3.6 Operator tokens
----------------------

R uses the following operator tokens

     `+ - * / %% ^'       arithmetic
     `> >= < <= == !='    relational
     `! & |'              logical
     `~'                  model formulae
     `-> <-'              assignment
     `$'                  list indexing
     `:'                  sequence

(Several of the operators have different meaning inside model formulas)


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Grouping,  Next: Indexing tokens,  Prev: Operator tokens,  Up: Tokens

10.3.7 Grouping
---------------

Ordinary parentheses--`(' and `)'--are used for explicit grouping
within expressions and to delimit the argument lists for function
definitions and function calls.

   Braces--`{' and `}'--delimit blocks of expressions in function
definitions, conditional expressions, and iterative constructs.

10.4 Expressions
================

An R program consists of a sequence of R expressions.  An expression
can be a simple expression consisting of only a constant or an
identifier, or it can be a compound expression constructed from other
parts (which may themselves be expressions).

   The following sections detail the various syntactical constructs that
are available.

* Menu:

* Function calls (expressions)::
* Infix and prefix operators::
* Index constructions::
* Compound expressions::
* Flow control elements::
* Function definitions::


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Function calls (expressions),  Next: Infix and prefix operators,  Prev: Expressions,  Up: Expressions

10.4.1 Function calls
---------------------

A function call takes the form of a function reference followed by a
comma-separated list of arguments within a set of parentheses.

     FUNCTION_REFERENCE ( ARG1, ARG2, ...... , ARGN )

   The function reference can be either
   * an identifier (the name of the function)

   * a text string (ditto, but handy if the function has a name which
     is not a valid identifier)

   * an expression (which should evaluate to a function object)

   Each argument can be tagged (`TAG=EXPR'), or just be a simple
expression.  It can also be empty or it can be one of the special
tokens `...', `..2', etc.

   A tag can be an identifier or a text string.

   Examples:

     f(x)
     g(tag = value, , 5)
     "odd name"("strange tag" = 5, y)
     (function(x) x^2)(5)


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Infix and prefix operators,  Next: Index constructions,  Prev: Function calls (expressions),  Up: Expressions

10.4.2 Infix and prefix operators
---------------------------------

The order of precedence (highest first) of the operators are

     ::
     $ @
     ^
     - +                (unary)
     :
     %XYZ%
     * /
     + -                (binary)
     > >= < <= == !=
     !
     & &&
     | ||
     ~                  (unary and binary)
     -> ->>
     =                  (as assignment)
     <- <<-

   The exponentiation operator `^' and the left assignment operators
`<- - = <<-' group right to left, all other operators group left to
right.  That is, `2 ^ 2 ^ 3' is 2 ^ 8, not 4 ^ 3, whereas `1 - 1 - 1'
is -1, not 1.

   Notice that the operators `%%' and `%/%' for integer remainder and
divide have higher precedence than multiply and divide.

   Although it is not strictly an operator, it also needs mentioning
that the `=' sign is used for tagging arguments in function calls and
for assigning default values in function definitions.

   The `$' sign is in some sense an operator, but does not allow
arbitrary right hand sides and is discussed under *note Index
constructions::.  It has higher precedence than any of the other
operators.

   The parsed form of a unary or binary operation is completely
equivalent to a function call with the operator as the function name
and the operands as the function arguments.

   Parentheses are recorded as equivalent to a unary operator, with name
`"("', even in cases where the parentheses could be inferred from
operator precedence (e.g., `a * (b + c)').

   Notice that the assignment symbols are operators just like the
arithmetic, relational, and logical ones.  Any expressions is allowed
also on the target side of an assignment, as far as the parser is
concerned (`2 + 2 <- 5' is a valid expression as far as the parser is
concerned.  The evaluator will object, though).  Similar comments apply
to the model formula operator.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Index constructions,  Next: Compound expressions,  Prev: Infix and prefix operators,  Up: Expressions

10.4.3 Index constructions
--------------------------

R has three indexing constructs, two of which are syntactically similar
although with somewhat different semantics:

     OBJECT [ ARG1, ...... , ARGN ]
     OBJECT [[ ARG1, ...... , ARGN ]]
   
   The OBJECT can formally be any valid expression, but it is
understood to denote or evaluate to a subsettable object.  The arguments
generally evaluate to numerical or character indices, but other kinds of
arguments are possible (notably `drop = FALSE').

   Internally, these index constructs are stored as function calls with
function name `"["' respectively `"[["'.

   The third index construction is

     OBJECT $ TAG
   
   Here, OBJECT is as above, whereas TAG is an identifier or a text
string.  Internally, it is stored as a function call with name `"$"'


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Compound expressions,  Next: Flow control elements,  Prev: Index constructions,  Up: Expressions

10.4.4 Compound expressions
---------------------------

A compound expression is of the form

     { EXPR1 ; EXPR2 ; ...... ; EXPRN }

   The semicolons may be replaced by newlines.  Internally, this is
stored as a function call with `"{"' as the function name and the
expressions as arguments.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Flow control elements,  Next: Function definitions,  Prev: Compound expressions,  Up: Expressions

10.4.5 Flow control elements
----------------------------

R contains the following control structures as special syntactic
constructs

     if ( COND ) EXPR
     if ( COND ) EXPR1 else EXPR2
     while ( COND ) EXPR
     repeat EXPR
     for ( VAR in LIST ) EXPR

   The expressions in these constructs will typically be compound
expressions.

   Within the loop constructs (`while', `repeat', `for'), one may use
`break' (to terminate the loop) and `next' (to skip to the next
iteration).

   Internally, the constructs are stored as function calls:

     "if"(COND, EXPR)
     "if"(COND, EXPR1, EXPR2)
     "while"(COND, EXPR)
     "repeat"(EXPR)
     "for"(VAR, LIST, EXPR)
     "break"()
     "next"()


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Function definitions,  Prev: Flow control elements,  Up: Expressions

10.4.6 Function definitions
---------------------------

A function definition is of the form

     function ( ARGLIST ) BODY

   The function body is an expression, often a compound expression.  The
ARGLIST is a comma-separated list of items each of which can be an
identifier, or of the form `IDENTIFIER = DEFAULT', or the special token
`...'.  The DEFAULT can be any valid expression.

   Notice that function arguments unlike list tags, etc., cannot have
"strange names" given as text strings.

   Internally, a function definition is stored as a function call with
function name `function' and two arguments, the ARGLIST and the BODY.
The ARGLIST is stored as a tagged pairlist where the tags are the
argument names and the values are the default expressions.


File: R-lang.info,  Node: Directives,  Prev: Expressions,  Up: Parser

10.5 Directives
===============

The parser currently only supports one directive, `#line'.  This is
similar to the C-preprocessor directive of the same name.  The syntax is

     #LINE NN [ `"filename"' ]

   where NN is an integer line number, and the optional FILENAME (in
required double quotes) names the source file.

   Unlike the C directive, `#line' must appear as the first five
characters on a line.  As in C, NN and `"filename"' entries may be
separated from it by whitespace.  And unlike C, any following text on
the line will be treated as a comment and ignored.

   This directive tells the parser that the following line should be
assumed to be line NN of file FILENAME.  (If the filename is not given,
it is assumed to be the same as for the previous directive.)  This is
not typically used by users, but may be used by preprocessors so that
diagnostic messages refer to the original file.
