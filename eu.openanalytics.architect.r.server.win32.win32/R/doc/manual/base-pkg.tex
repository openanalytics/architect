Base R functions
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
This package contains the basic functions which let \R{}
function as a language:  arithmetic, input/output, basic
programming support, etc.  Its contents are available through
inheritance from any environment.

For a complete
list of functions, use \code{library(help="base")}.

\HeaderA{.bincode}{Bin a Numeric Vector}{.bincode}
\keyword{category}{.bincode}
%
\begin{Description}\relax
Bin a numeric vector and return integer codes for the binning.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
.bincode(x, breaks, right = TRUE, include.lowest = FALSE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] a numeric vector which is to be converted to integer codes by
binning.
\item[\code{breaks}] a numeric vector of two or more cut points, sorted in
increasing order.
\item[\code{right}] logical, indicating if the intervals should be closed on
the right (and open on the left) or vice versa.
\item[\code{include.lowest}] logical, indicating if an `x[i]' equal to
the lowest (or highest, for \code{right = FALSE}) `breaks'
value should be included in the first (or last) bin.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
This is a `barebones' version of \code{cut.default(labels =
    FALSE)} intended for use in other functions which have checked the
arguments passed.

Unlike \code{\LinkA{cut}{cut}}, the \code{breaks} do not need to be unique.
An input can only fall into a zero-length interval if it is closed
at both ends, so only if \code{include.lowest = TRUE} and it is the
first (or last for \code{right = FALSE}) interval.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
An integer vector of the same length as \code{x} indicating which bin
each element falls into (the leftmost bin being bin \code{1}).
\code{NaN} and \code{NA} elements of \code{x} are mapped to
\code{NA} codes, as are values outside range of \code{breaks}.

\keyword{device}{.Device}
%
\begin{Description}\relax
A pairlist of the names of open graphics devices is stored in
\code{.Devices}. The name of the active device (see
\code{\LinkA{dev.cur}{dev.cur}}) is stored in \code{.Device}.  Both are symbols
and so appear in the base namespace.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{.Device} is a length-one character vector.

\code{.Devices} is a \LinkA{pairlist}{pairlist} of length-one character vectors.
The first entry is always \code{"null device"}, and there are as many
entries as the maximal number of graphics devices which have been
simultaneously active.  If a device has been removed, its entry will be
\code{""} until the device number is reused.

%
\begin{Description}\relax
\code{.Machine} is a variable holding information on the numerical
characteristics of the machine \R{} is running on, such as the largest
double or integer and the machine's precision.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
.Machine
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The algorithm is based on Cody's (1988) subroutine MACHAR.  As
all current implementations of \R{} use 32-bit integers and almost all
use IEC 60559 floating-point (double precision) arithmetic, all but
the last two values are the same for almost all \R{} builds.

Note that on most platforms smaller positive values than
\code{.Machine\$double.xmin} can occur.  On a typical \R{} platform the
smallest positive double is about \code{5e-324}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
A list with components
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{double.eps}] the smallest positive floating-point number
\code{x} such that \code{1 + x != 1}.  It equals
\code{double.base \textasciicircum{} ulp.digits} if either \code{double.base} is 2 or
\code{double.rounding} is 0;  otherwise, it is
\code{(double.base \textasciicircum{} double.ulp.digits) / 2}.  Normally
\code{2.220446e-16}.
\item[\code{double.neg.eps}] a small positive floating-point number \code{x}
such that \code{1 - x != 1}.  It equals
\code{double.base \textasciicircum{} double.neg.ulp.digits} if \code{double.base} is 2
or \code{double.rounding} is 0;  otherwise, it is
\code{(double.base \textasciicircum{} double.neg.ulp.digits) / 2}.  Normally
\code{1.110223e-16}. As \code{double.neg.ulp.digits} is bounded
below by \code{-(double.digits + 3)}, \code{double.neg.eps} may not
be the smallest number that can alter 1 by subtraction.
\item[\code{double.xmin}] the smallest non-zero normalized
floating-point number, a power of the radix, i.e.,
\code{double.base \textasciicircum{} double.min.exp}. Normally \code{2.225074e-308}.
\item[\code{double.xmax}] the largest normalized floating-point number.
Typically, it is equal to \code{(1 - double.neg.eps) *
      double.base \textasciicircum{} double.max.exp}, but
on some machines it is only the second or third largest such
number, being too small by 1 or 2 units in the last digit of the
significand.  Normally \code{1.797693e+308}.  Note that larger
unnormalized numbers can occur.
\item[\code{double.base}] the radix for the floating-point representation:
normally \code{2}.
\item[\code{double.digits}] the number of base digits in the floating-point
significand: normally \code{53}.
\item[\code{double.rounding}] the rounding action, one of\\{}
0 if floating-point addition chops; \\{}
1 if floating-point addition rounds, but not in the IEEE style; \\{}
2 if floating-point addition rounds in the IEEE style; \\{}
3 if floating-point addition chops, and there is partial underflow; \\{}
4 if floating-point addition rounds, but not in the IEEE style, and
there is partial underflow; \\{}
5 if floating-point addition rounds in the IEEE style, and there is
partial underflow.\\{}
Normally \code{5}.
\item[\code{double.guard}] the number of guard digits for multiplication
with truncating arithmetic.  It is 1 if floating-point arithmetic
truncates and more than \code{double digits} base-\code{double.base} digits
participate in the post-normalization shift of the floating-point
significand in multiplication, and 0 otherwise.
\item[\code{double.ulp.digits}] the largest negative integer \code{i} such
that \code{1 + double.base \textasciicircum{} i != 1}, except that it is bounded below by
\code{-(double.digits + 3)}.  Normally \code{-52}.
\item[\code{double.neg.ulp.digits}] the largest negative integer \code{i}
such that \code{1 - double.base \textasciicircum{} i != 1}, except that it is bounded
below by \code{-(double.digits + 3)}. Normally \code{-53}.
\item[\code{double.exponent}] 
the number of bits (decimal places if \code{double.base} is 10) reserved
for the representation of the exponent (including the bias or sign)
of a floating-point number.  Normally \code{11}.
\item[\code{double.min.exp}] 
the largest in magnitude negative integer \code{i} such that
\code{double.base \textasciicircum{} i} is positive and normalized.  Normally \code{-1022}.
\item[\code{double.max.exp}] 
the smallest positive power of \code{double.base} that overflows.  Normally
\code{1024}.
\item[\code{integer.max}] the largest integer which can be represented.
Always \code{2147483647}.
\item[\code{sizeof.long}] the number of bytes in a C \code{long} type:
\code{4} or \code{8} (most 64-bit systems, but not Windows).
\item[\code{sizeof.longlong}] the number of bytes in a C \code{long long}
type.  Will be zero if there is no such type, otherwise usually
\code{8}.
\item[\code{sizeof.longdouble}] the number of bytes in a C \code{long double}
type.  Will be zero if there is no such type, otherwise possibly
\code{12} (most 32-bit builds) or \code{16} (most 64-bit builds).
\item[\code{sizeof.pointer}] the number of bytes in a C \code{SEXP}
type.  Will be \code{4} on 32-bit builds and \code{8} on 64-bit
builds of \R{}.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
\code{sizeof.longdouble} only tells you the amount of storage
allocated for a long double (which are used internally by \R{} for
accumulators in e.g. \code{\LinkA{sum}{sum}}, and can be read by
\code{\LinkA{readBin}{readBin}}).  Often what is stored is the 80-bit extended
double type of IEC 60559, padded to the double alignment used on the
platform --- this seems to be the case for the common \R{} platforms
using ix86 and x86\_64 chips.

\begin{Description}\relax
\code{.Platform} is a list with some details of the platform under

code.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
.Platform
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Value}
A list with at least the following components:

\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{OS.type}] 
character string, giving the \bold{O}perating \bold{S}ystem
(family) of the computer.  One of \code{"unix"} or \code{"windows"}.

\item[\code{file.sep}] 
character string, giving the \bold{file} \bold{sep}arator used on your
platform: \code{"/"} on both Unix-alikes \emph{and} on Windows (but
not on the once port to Classic Mac OS).

\item[\code{dynlib.ext}] 
character string, giving the file name \bold{ext}ension of
\bold{dyn}amically loadable \bold{lib}raries, e.g., \code{".dll"} on
Windows and \code{".so"} or \code{".sl"} on Unix-alikes.  (Note for
Mac OS X users: these are shared objects as loaded by
\code{\LinkA{dyn.load}{dyn.load}} and not dylibs: see \code{\LinkA{dyn.load}{dyn.load}}.)

\item[\code{GUI}] 
character string, giving the type of GUI in use, or \code{"unknown"}
if no GUI can be assumed.  Possible values are for Unix-alikes the
values given via the \option{-g} command-line flag (\code{"X11"},
\code{"Tk"}), \code{"AQUA"} (running under \code{R.app} on Mac OS X),
\code{"Rgui"} and \code{"RTerm"} (Windows) and perhaps others under
alternative front-ends or embedded \R{}.

\item[\code{endian}] 
character string, \code{"big"} or \code{"little"}, giving the
endianness of the processor in use.  This is relevant when it is
necessary to know the order to read/write bytes of e.g. an integer or
double from/to a \LinkA{connection}{connection}: see \code{\LinkA{readBin}{readBin}}. 

\item[\code{pkgType}] 
character string, the preferred setting for

\code{"mac.binary.leopard"} and \code{"win.binary"} are currently in
use.

\item[\code{path.sep}] 
character string, giving the \bold{path} \bold{sep}arator,
used on your platform, e.g., \code{":"} on Unix-alikes and
\code{";"} on Windows.  Used to separate paths in environment
variables such as \code{PATH} and \code{TEXINPUTS}.

\item[\code{r\_arch}] 
character string, possibly \code{""}.  The name of an
architecture-specific directory used in this build of \R{}.

\end{ldescription}
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{AQUA}
\code{.Platform\$GUI} is set to \code{"AQUA"} under the Mac OS X GUI,
\code{R.app}. This has a number of consequences:
\begin{itemize}

\item the \env{DISPLAY} environment variable is set to \code{":0"} if unset.
\item appends \file{/usr/local/bin} to the \env{PATH} environment variable.
\item the default graphics device is set to \code{quartz}.
\item selects native (rather than Tk) widgets for the \code{graphics
      = TRUE} options of \code{\LinkA{menu}{menu}} and \code{\LinkA{select.list}{select.list}}.
\item HTML help is displayed in the internal browser.

Abbreviate strings to at least \code{minlength} characters,
such that they remain \emph{unique} (if they were),
unless \code{strict=TRUE}.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
abbreviate(names.arg, minlength = 4, use.classes = TRUE,
           dot = FALSE, strict = FALSE,
           method = c("left.kept", "both.sides"))
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{names.arg}] a character vector of names to be abbreviated, or an
object to be coerced to a character vector by \code{\LinkA{as.character}{as.character}}.
\item[\code{minlength}] the minimum length of the abbreviations.
\item[\code{use.classes}] logical (currently ignored by \R{}).
\item[\code{dot}] logical: should a dot (\code{"."}) be appended?
\item[\code{strict}] logical: should \code{minlength} be observed strictly?
Note that setting \code{strict=TRUE} may return \emph{non}-unique
strings.
\item[\code{method}] a string specifying the method used with default
\code{"left.kept"}, see `Details' below.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The algorithm (\code{method = "left.kept"}) used is similar to that of
S.  For a single string it works as follows.
First all spaces at the beginning of the string are stripped.
Then (if necessary) any other spaces are stripped.
Next, lower case vowels are removed (starting at the right)
followed by lower case consonants.
Finally if the abbreviation is still longer than \code{minlength}
upper case letters are stripped.

Characters are always stripped from the end of the word first.
If an element of \code{names.arg} contains more than one word (words
are separated by space) then at least one letter from each word will be
retained.

Missing (\code{NA}) values are unaltered.

If \code{use.classes} is \code{FALSE} then the only distinction is to
be between letters and space.  This has NOT been implemented.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
A character vector containing abbreviations for the strings in its
first argument.  Duplicates in the original \code{names.arg} will be
given identical abbreviations.  If any non-duplicated elements have
the same \code{minlength} abbreviations then, if \code{method =
  "both.sides"} the basic internal \code{abbreviate()} algorithm is
applied to the characterwise \emph{reversed} strings; if there are
still duplicated abbreviations and if \code{strict=FALSE} as by
default, \code{minlength} is incremented by one and new abbreviations
are found for those elements only.  This process is repeated until all
unique elements of \code{names.arg} have unique abbreviations.

The character version of \code{names.arg} is attached to the returned
value as a names argument: no other attributes are retained.
\end{Value}

non-ASCII characters.

Searches for approximate matches to \code{pattern} (the first argument)
within each element of the string \code{x} (the second argument) using
the generalized Levenshtein edit distance (the minimal possibly
weighted number of insertions, deletions and substitutions needed to
transform one string into another).

agrep(pattern, x, max.distance = 0.1, costs = NULL, 
      ignore.case = FALSE, value = FALSE, fixed = TRUE,
      useBytes = FALSE)

%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{pattern}] a non-empty character string or a character string
containing a regular expression (for \code{fixed = FALSE}) to be
matched.
Coerced by \code{\LinkA{as.character}{as.character}} to a string if possible.
\item[\code{x}] character vector where matches are sought.
Coerced by \code{\LinkA{as.character}{as.character}} to a character vector if
possible.
\item[\code{max.distance}] Maximum distance allowed for a match.  Expressed
either as integer, or as a fraction of the \emph{pattern} length
times the maximal transformation cost (will be replaced by the
smallest integer not less than the corresponding fraction), or a
list with possible components
\begin{description}

\item[\code{cost}:] maximum number/fraction of match cost
(generalized Levenshtein distance)
\item[\code{all}:] maximal number/fraction of \emph{all}
transformations (insertions, deletions and substitutions)
\item[\code{insertions}:] maximum number/fraction of insertions
\item[\code{deletions}:] maximum number/fraction of deletions
\item[\code{substitutions}:] maximum number/fraction of
substitutions

\end{description}

If \code{cost} is not given, \code{all} defaults to 10\%, and the
other transformation number bounds default to \code{all}.
The component names can be abbreviated.

\item[\code{costs}] a numeric vector or list with names partially matching
\samp{insertions}, \samp{deletions} and \samp{substitutions} giving
the respective costs for computing the generalized Levenshtein
distance, or \code{NULL} (default) indicating using unit cost for
all three possible transformations.
Coerced to integer via \code{\LinkA{as.integer}{as.integer}} if possible.
\item[\code{ignore.case}] if \code{FALSE}, the pattern matching is \emph{case
sensitive} and if \code{TRUE}, case is ignored during matching.
\item[\code{value}] if \code{FALSE}, a vector containing the (integer)
indices of the matches determined is returned and if \code{TRUE}, a
vector containing the matching elements themselves is returned.
\item[\code{fixed}] logical.  If \code{TRUE} (default), the pattern is
matched literally (as is).  Otherwise, it is matched as a regular
expression.
\item[\code{useBytes}] logical. in a multibyte locale, should the comparison
be character-by-character (the default) or byte-by-byte.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The Levenshtein edit distance is used as measure of approximateness:
it is the (possibly cost-weighted) total number of insertions,
deletions and substitutions required to transform one string into
another.

As from \R{} 2.10.0 this uses \code{tre} by Ville Laurikari
(\url{http://http://laurikari.net/tre/}), which supports MBCS
character matching much better than the previous version.

The main effect of \code{useBytes} is to avoid errors/warnings about
invalid inputs and spurious matches in multibyte locales.
It inhibits the conversion of inputs with marked encodings, and is
forced if any input is found which is marked as \code{"bytes"}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
Either a vector giving the indices of the elements that yielded a
match, or, if \code{value} is \code{TRUE}, the matched elements (after
coercion, preserving names but no other attributes).

%
\begin{Note}\relax
Since someone who read the description carelessly even filed a bug
report on it, do note that this matches substrings of each element of
\code{x} (just as \code{\LinkA{grep}{grep}} does) and \bold{not} whole
elements.  See \code{\LinkA{adist}{adist}} in package \pkg{utils}, which
optionally returns the offsets of the matched substrings.

\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{...}] zero or more logical vectors.  Other objects of zero
length are ignored, and the rest are coerced to logical ignoring
any class.
\item[\code{na.rm}] logical.  If true \code{NA} values are removed before
the result is computed.

%
\begin{Details}\relax
This is a generic function: methods can be defined for it
directly or via the \code{\LinkA{Summary}{S3groupGeneric}} group generic.
For this to work properly, the arguments \code{...} should be
unnamed, and dispatch is on the first argument.

Coercion of types other than integer (raw, double, complex, character,
list) gives a warning as this is often unintentional.

This is a \LinkA{primitive}{primitive} function.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
The value is a logical vector of length one.

Let \code{x} denote the concatenation of all the logical vectors in
\code{...} (after coercion), after removing \code{NA}s if requested by
\code{na.rm = TRUE}.

The value returned is \code{TRUE} if all of the values in \code{x} are
\code{TRUE} (including if there are no values), and \code{FALSE} if at
least one of the values in \code{x} is \code{FALSE}.  Otherwise the
value is \code{NA} (which can only occur if \code{na.rm = FALSE} and
\code{...} contains no \code{FALSE} values and at least one
\code{NA} value).

\code{all.equal(x,y)} is a utility to compare \R{} objects \code{x}
and \code{y} testing `near equality'.  If they are different,
comparison is still made to some extent, and a report of the
differences is returned.    Don't use \code{all.equal} directly in
\code{if} expressions---either use \code{isTRUE(all.equal(....))} or
\code{\LinkA{identical}{identical}} if appropriate.
\end{Description}

\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
all.equal(target, current, ...)

## S3 method for class 'numeric'
all.equal(target, current,
          tolerance = .Machine$double.eps ^ 0.5,
          scale = NULL, check.attributes = TRUE, ...)

               check.attributes = TRUE, check.names = TRUE, ...)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{target}] \R{} object.
\item[\code{current}] other \R{} object, to be compared with \code{target}.
\item[\code{...}] Further arguments for different methods, notably the
following two, for numerical comparison:
\item[\code{tolerance}] numeric \eqn{\ge}{} 0.  Differences smaller than
\code{tolerance} are not considered.
\item[\code{scale}] numeric scalar > 0 (or \code{NULL}). See `Details'.
\item[\code{check.attributes}] logical indicating if the
\code{\LinkA{attributes}{attributes}(.)} of \code{target} and \code{current}
should be compared as well.
\item[\code{check.names}] logical indicating if the \code{\LinkA{names}{names}(.)}
of \code{target} and \code{current} should be compared as well (and
separately from the \code{attributes}).
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{all.equal} is a generic function, dispatching methods on the
\code{target} argument.  To see the available methods, use
\code{\LinkA{methods}{methods}("all.equal")}, but note that the default method
also does some dispatching, e.g. using the raw method for logical
targets.

Numerical comparisons for \code{scale = NULL} (the default) are done
by first computing the mean absolute difference of the two numerical
vectors.  If this is smaller than \code{tolerance} or not finite,
absolute differences are used, otherwise relative differences scaled
by the mean absolute difference.

If \code{scale} is positive, absolute comparisons are made after
scaling (dividing) by \code{scale}.

For complex \code{target}, the modulus (\code{\LinkA{Mod}{Mod}}) of the
difference is used: \code{all.equal.numeric} is called so arguments
\code{tolerance} and \code{scale} are available.

\code{attr.all.equal} is used for comparing
\code{\LinkA{attributes}{attributes}}, returning \code{NULL} or a
\code{character} vector.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
Either \code{TRUE} (\code{NULL} for \code{attr.all.equal}) or a vector
of \code{\LinkA{mode}{mode}} \code{"character"} describing the differences
between \code{target} and \code{current}.

\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{a}] the array to be transposed.
\item[\code{perm}] the subscript permutation vector, usually a permutation of
the integers \code{1:n}, where \code{n} is the number of dimensions
of \code{a}.  When \code{a} has named dimnames, it can be a
character vector of length \code{n} giving a permutation of those
names. The default (used whenever \code{perm} has zero length) is to
reverse the order of the dimensions.
\item[\code{resize}] a flag indicating whether the vector should be
resized as well as having its elements reordered (default \code{TRUE}).
\item[\code{keep.class}] logical indicating if the result should be of the
same class as \code{a}.
\item[\code{...}] potential further arguments of methods.

%
\begin{Value}
A transposed version of array \code{a}, with subscripts permuted as
indicated by the array \code{perm}.  If \code{resize} is \code{TRUE},
the array is reshaped as well as having its elements permuted, the
\code{dimnames} are also permuted; if \code{resize = FALSE} then the
returned object has the same dimensions as \code{a}, and the dimnames

\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
apply(X, MARGIN, FUN, ...)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{X}] an array, including a matrix.
\item[\code{MARGIN}] a vector giving the subscripts which the function will
be applied over.  E.g., for a matrix \code{1} indicates rows,
\code{2} indicates columns, \code{c(1, 2)} indicates rows and
columns. Where \code{X} has named dimnames, it can be a character
vector selecting dimension names.
\item[\code{FUN}] the function to be applied: see `Details'.
In the case of functions like \code{+}, \code{\%*\%}, etc., the
function name must be backquoted or quoted.
\item[\code{...}] optional arguments to \code{FUN}.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
If \code{X} is not an array but an object of a class with a non-null
\code{\LinkA{dim}{dim}} value (such as a data frame), \code{apply} attempts
to coerce it to an array via \code{as.matrix} if it is two-dimensional
(e.g., a data frame) or via \code{as.array}.

\code{FUN} is found by a call to \code{\LinkA{match.fun}{match.fun}} and typically
is either a function or a symbol (e.g. a backquoted name) or a
character string specifying a function to be searched for from the
environment of the call to \code{apply}.

Arguments in \code{...} cannot have the same name as any of the
other arguments, and care may be needed to avoid partial matching to
\code{MARGIN} or \code{FUN}.  In general-purpose code it is good
practice to name the first three arguments if \code{...} is passed
through: this both avoids partial matching to \code{MARGIN}
or \code{FUN} and ensures that a sensible error message is given if
arguments named \code{X}, \code{MARGIN} or \code{FUN} are passed
through \code{...}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
If each call to \code{FUN} returns a vector of length \code{n}, then
\code{apply} returns an array of dimension \code{c(n, dim(X)[MARGIN])}
if \code{n > 1}.  If \code{n} equals \code{1}, \code{apply} returns a
vector if \code{MARGIN} has length 1 and an array of dimension
\code{dim(X)[MARGIN]} otherwise.
If \code{n} is \code{0}, the result has length 0 but not necessarily
the `correct' dimension.

If the calls to \code{FUN} return vectors of different lengths,
\code{apply} returns a list of length \code{prod(dim(X)[MARGIN])} with
\code{dim} set to \code{MARGIN} if this has length greater than one.

In all cases the result is coerced by \code{\LinkA{as.vector}{as.vector}} to one
of the basic vector types before the dimensions are set, so that (for
example) factor results will be coerced to a character array.

\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x, y}] numeric or complex vectors or objects which can be
coerced to such, or other objects for which methods have been written.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The binary arithmetic operators are generic functions: methods can be
written for them individually or via the
\code{\LinkA{Ops}{S3groupGeneric}} group generic function.  (See
\code{\LinkA{Ops}{S3groupGeneric}} for how dispatch is computed.)

If applied to arrays the result will be an array if this is sensible
(for example it will not if the recycling rule has been invoked).

Logical vectors will be coerced to integer or numeric vectors,
\code{FALSE} having value zero and \code{TRUE} having value one.

\code{1 \textasciicircum{} y} and \code{y \textasciicircum{} 0} are \code{1}, \emph{always}.
\code{x \textasciicircum{} y} should also give the proper limit result when
either argument is infinite (i.e., \code{+- \LinkA{Inf}{Inf}}).

Objects such as arrays or time-series can be operated on this
way provided they are conformable.

For real arguments, \code{\%\%} can be subject to catastrophic loss of
accuracy if \code{x} is much larger than \code{y}, and a warning is
given if this is detected.

\code{\%\%} and \code{x \%/\% y} can be used for non-integer \code{y},
e.g. \code{1 \%/\% 0.2}, but the results are subject to representation
error and so may be platform-dependent.  Because the IEC 60059
representation of \code{0.2} is a binary fraction slightly larger than
\code{0.2}, the answer to \code{1 \%/\% 0.2} should be \code{4} but
most platforms give \code{5}.

Users are sometimes surprised by the value returned, for example why
\code{(-8)\textasciicircum{}(1/3)} is \code{NaN}.  For \LinkA{double}{double} inputs, \R{} makes
use of IEC 60559 arithmetic on all platforms, together with the C
system function \samp{pow} for the \code{\textasciicircum{}} operator.  The relevant
standards define the result in many corner cases.  In particular, the
result in the example above is mandated by the C99 standard.  On many
Unix-alike systems the command \command{man pow} gives details of the
values in a large number of corner cases.

Arithmetic on type \LinkA{double}{double} in \R{} is supposed to be done in
`round to nearest, ties to even' mode, but this does depend on
the compiler and FPU being set up correctly. 
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
These operators return vectors containing the result of the element
by element operations.  The elements of shorter vectors are recycled
as necessary (with a \code{\LinkA{warning}{warning}} when they are recycled only
\emph{fractionally}).  The operators are \code{+} for addition,
\code{-} for subtraction, \code{*} for multiplication, \code{/} for
division and \code{\textasciicircum{}} for exponentiation.

\code{\%\%} indicates \code{x mod y} and \code{\%/\%} indicates
integer division.  It is guaranteed that \code{x == (x \%\% y) + y * (
  x \%/\% y )} (up to rounding error) unless \code{y == 0} where the
result of \code{\%\%} is \code{\LinkA{NA\_integer\_}{NA.Rul.integer.Rul.}} or
\code{\LinkA{NaN}{NaN}} (depending on the \code{\LinkA{typeof}{typeof}} of the
arguments).

If either argument is complex the result will be complex, otherwise if
one or both arguments are numeric, the result will be numeric.  If
both arguments are of type \LinkA{integer}{integer}, the type of the result of
\code{/} and \code{\textasciicircum{}} is \LinkA{numeric}{numeric} and for the other operators it
is integer (with overflow, which occurs at
\eqn{\pm(2^{31} - 1)}{},
returned as \code{NA\_integer\_} with a warning).

The rules for determining the attributes of the result are rather
complicated.  Most attributes are taken from the longer argument, the
first if they are of the same length.  Names will be copied from the
first if it is the same length as the answer, otherwise from the
second if that is.  For time series, these operations are allowed only
if the series are compatible, when the class and \code{\LinkA{tsp}{tsp}}
attribute of whichever is a time series (the same, if both are) are
used.  For arrays (and an array result) the dimensions and dimnames
are taken from first argument if it is an array, otherwise the second.

\begin{Section}{S4 methods}
These operators are members of the S4 \code{\LinkA{Arith}{Arith}} group generic,
and so methods can be written for them individually as well as for the
group generic (or the \code{Ops} group generic), with arguments
\code{c(e1, e2)}.
\end{Section}

\begin{Section}{Implementation limits}
\R{} is dependent on OS services (and they on FPUs) for floating-point
arithmetic.  On all current \R{} platforms IEC 60559 (also known as IEEE
754) arithmetic is used, but some things in those standards are
optional.  In particular, the support for \emph{denormal numbers}
(those outside the range given by \code{\LinkA{.Machine}{.Machine}}) may differ
between platforms and even between calculations on a single platform.

Another potential issue is signed zeroes: on IEC 60659 platforms there
are two zeroes with internal representations differing by sign.  Where
possible \R{} treats them as the same, but for example direct output
from C code often does not do so and may output \samp{-0.0} (and on
Windows whether it does so or not depends on the version of Windows).
One place in \R{} where the difference might be seen is in division by
zero: \code{1/x} is \code{Inf} or \code{-Inf} depending on the sign of
zero \code{x}.

\begin{Details}\relax
An array in \R{} can have one, two or more dimensions.  It is simply a
vector which is stored with additional \LinkA{attributes}{attributes} giving the
dimensions (attribute \code{"dim"}) and optionally names for those
dimensions (attribute \code{"dimnames"}).

A two-dimensional array is the same thing as a \code{\LinkA{matrix}{matrix}}.

One-dimensional arrays often look like vectors, but may be handled
differently by some functions: \code{\LinkA{str}{str}} does distinguish
them in recent versions of \R{}.

The \code{"dim"} attribute is an integer vector of length one or more
containing non-negative values: the product of the values must match
the length of the array.

The \code{"dimnames"} attribute is optional: if present it is a list
with one component for each dimension, either \code{NULL} or a
character vector of the length given by the element of the
\code{"dim"} attribute for that dimension.  

\code{is.array} is a \LinkA{primitive}{primitive} function.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{array} returns an array with the extents specified in \code{dim}
and naming information in \code{dimnames}.  The values in \code{data} are
taken to be those in the array with the leftmost subscript moving
fastest.  If there are too few elements in \code{data} to fill the array,
then the elements in \code{data} are recycled.  If \code{data} has
length zero, \code{NA} of an appropriate type is used for atomic
vectors (\code{0} for raw vectors) and \code{NULL} for lists.

In the deprecated case that \code{dims} has length 0, the result will
be a vector of length 1 and a warning will be given.

Unlike \code{\LinkA{matrix}{matrix}}, \code{array} does not currently remove
any attributes left by \code{as.vector} from a classed list
\code{data}, so can return a list array with a class attribute.

\code{as.array} is a generic function for coercing to arrays.  The
default method does so by attaching a \code{\LinkA{dim}{dim}} attribute to
it.  It also attaches \code{\LinkA{dimnames}{dimnames}} if \code{x} has
\code{\LinkA{names}{names}}.  The sole purpose of this is to make it possible
to access the \code{dim[names]} attribute at a later time.

\code{is.array} returns \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} depending on
whether its argument is an array (i.e., has a \code{dim} attribute of
positive length) or not.  It is generic: you can write methods to handle
specific classes of objects, see \LinkA{InternalMethods}{InternalMethods}.

\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{as.data.frame} is a generic function with many methods, and
users and packages can supply further methods.

If a list is supplied, each element is converted to a column in the
data frame.  Similarly, each column of a matrix is converted separately.
This can be overridden if the object has a class which has
a method for \code{as.data.frame}: two examples are
matrices of class \code{"\LinkA{model.matrix}{model.matrix}"} (which are
included as a single column) and list objects of class
\code{"\LinkA{POSIXlt}{POSIXlt}"} which are coerced to class
\code{"\LinkA{POSIXct}{POSIXct}"}.

Arrays can be converted to data frames.  One-dimensional arrays are
treated like vectors and two-dimensional arrays like matrices.  Arrays
with more than two dimensions are converted to matrices by
`flattening' all dimensions after the first and creating
suitable column labels.

Character variables are converted to factor columns unless protected
by \code{\LinkA{I}{I}}.

If a data frame is supplied, all classes preceding \code{"data.frame"}
are stripped, and the row names are changed if that argument is supplied.

If \code{row.names = NULL}, row names are constructed from the names
or dimnames of \code{x}, otherwise are the integer sequence
starting at one.  Few of the methods check for duplicated row names.
Names are removed from vector columns unless \code{\LinkA{I}{I}}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{as.data.frame} returns a data frame, normally with all row names
\code{""} if \code{optional = TRUE}.

\code{is.data.frame} returns \code{TRUE} if its argument is a data
frame (that is, has \code{"data.frame"} amongst its classes)
and \code{FALSE} otherwise.

%
\begin{Details}\relax
The usual vector re-cycling rules are applied to \code{x} and
\code{format} so the answer will be of length that of the longer of the
vectors.

Locale-specific conversions to and from character strings are used
where appropriate and available.  This affects the names of the days
and months.

The \code{as.Date} methods accept character strings, factors, logical
\code{NA} and objects of classes \code{"\LinkA{POSIXlt}{POSIXlt}"} and
\code{"\LinkA{POSIXct}{POSIXct}"}.  (The last is converted to days by ignoring
the time after midnight in the representation of the time in specified
timezone, default UTC.)  Also objects of class \code{"date"} (from
package \pkg{\LinkA{date}{date}}) and \code{"dates"} (from
package \pkg{\LinkA{chron}{chron}}).  Character strings are processed
as far as necessary for the format specified: any trailing characters
are ignored.

\code{as.Date} will accept numeric data (the number of days since an
epoch), but \emph{only} if \code{origin} is supplied.

The \code{format} and \code{as.character} methods ignore any
fractional part of the date.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
The \code{format} and \code{as.character} methods return a character vector
representing the date.  \code{NA} dates are returned as \code{NA\_character\_}.

The \code{as.Date} methods return an object of class \code{"\LinkA{Date}{Date}"}.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{Conversion from other Systems}
Most systems record dates internally as the number of days since some
origin, but this is fraught with problems, including
\begin{itemize}

\item Is the origin day 0 or day 1?  As the `Examples' show,
Excel manages to use both choices for its two date systems.
\item If the origin is far enough back, the designers may show their
ignorance of calendar systems.  For example, Excel's designer
thought 1900 was a leap year (claiming to copy the error from
earlier DOS spreadsheets), and Matlab's designer chose the
non-existent date of `January 0, 0000' (there is no such day),
not specifying the calendar.  (There is such a year in the
`Gregorian' calendar as used in ISO 8601:2004, but that does say
that it is only to be used for years before 1582 with the agreement
of the parties in information exchange.)

\end{itemize}

The only safe procedure is to check the other systems values for known
dates: reports on the Internet (including R-help) are more often wrong
than right.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
The default formats follow the rules of the ISO 8601 international
standard which expresses a day as \code{"2001-02-03"}.

If the date string does not specify the date completely, the returned
answer may be system-specific.  The most common behaviour is to assume
that a missing year, month or day is the current one.  If it specifies
a date incorrectly, reliable implementations will give an error and
the date is reported as \code{NA}.  Unfortunately some common
implementations (such as \samp{glibc}) are unreliable and guess at the
intended meaning.

Years before 1CE (aka 1AD) will probably not be handled correctly.

\begin{Description}\relax
Functions to manipulate objects of classes \code{"POSIXlt"} and
\code{"POSIXct"} representing calendar dates and times.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
as.POSIXct(x, tz = "", ...)
as.POSIXlt(x, tz = "", ...)

## S3 method for class 'character'
as.POSIXlt(x, tz = "", format, ...)

## S3 method for class 'numeric'
as.POSIXlt(x, tz = "", origin, ...)

## S3 method for class 'POSIXlt'
as.double(x, ...)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] An object to be converted.
\item[\code{tz}] A timezone specification to be used for the conversion,
\emph{if one is required}.  System-specific (see \LinkA{time zones}{time zones}),
but \code{""} is the current timezone, and \code{"GMT"} is UTC
(Universal Time, Coordinated).
\item[\code{...}] further arguments to be passed to or from other methods.
\item[\code{format}] character string giving a date-time format as used
by \code{\LinkA{strptime}{strptime}}.
\item[\code{origin}] a date-time object, or something which can be coerced by
\code{as.POSIXct(tz="GMT")} to such an object.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The \code{as.POSIX*} functions convert an object to one of the two
classes used to represent date/times (calendar dates plus time to the
nearest second).  They can convert a wide variety of objects,
including objects of the other class and of classes \code{"Date"},
\code{"date"} (from package \pkg{\LinkA{date}{date}}),
\code{"chron"} and \code{"dates"} (from package
\pkg{\LinkA{chron}{chron}}) to these classes.  Dates without times are
treated as being at midnight UTC.

They can also convert character strings of the formats
\code{"2001-02-03"} and \code{"2001/02/03"} optionally followed by
white space and a time in the format \code{"14:52"} or
\code{"14:52:03"}.  (Formats such as \code{"01/02/03"} are ambiguous
but can be converted via a format specification by
\code{\LinkA{strptime}{strptime}}.)  Fractional seconds are allowed.
Alternatively, \code{format} can be specified for character vectors or
factors: if it is not specified and no standard format works for
all non-\code{NA} inputs an error is thrown.

If \code{format} is specified, remember that some of the format
specifications are locale-specific, and you may need to set the
\code{LC\_TIME} category appropriately \emph{via}
\code{\LinkA{Sys.setlocale}{Sys.setlocale}}.  This most often affects the use of
\code{\%b}, \code{\%B} (month names) and \code{\%p} (AM/PM).

Logical \code{NA}s can be converted to either of the classes, but no
other logical vectors can be.

The \code{as.double} method converts \code{"POSIXlt"} objects to
\code{"POSIXct"}.

If you are given a numeric time as the number of seconds since an
epoch, see the examples.

Character input is first converted to class \code{"POSIXlt"} by
\code{\LinkA{strptime}{strptime}}: numeric input is first converted to
\code{"POSIXct"}.  Any conversion that needs to go between the two
date-time classes requires a timezone: conversion from
\code{"POSIXlt"} to \code{"POSIXct"} will validate times in the
selected timezone.  One issue is what happens at transitions
to and from DST, for example in the UK
\begin{alltt}as.POSIXct(strptime('2011-03-27 01:30:00', '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'))
as.POSIXct(strptime('2010-10-31 01:30:00', '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'))
\end{alltt}

are respectively invalid (the clocks went forward at 1:00 GMT to 2:00
BST) and ambiguous (the clocks went back at 2:00 BST to 1:00 GMT).  What
happens in such cases is OS-specific: one should expect the first to
be \code{NA}, but the second could be interpreted as either BST or
GMT (and common OSes give both possible values).  Note too (see
\code{\LinkA{strftime}{strftime}}), OS facilities may not format invalid times correctly.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{as.POSIXct} and \code{as.POSIXlt} return an object of the
appropriate class.  If \code{tz} was specified, \code{as.POSIXlt}
will give an appropriate \code{"tzone"} attribute.  Date-times known
to be invalid will be returned as \code{NA}.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
Some of the concepts used have to be extended backwards in time (the
usage is \emph{proleptic}).  For example, the origin of time for the
\code{"POSIXct"} class, `1970-01-01 00:00.00 UTC', is before UTC
was defined.  More importantly, conversion is done assuming the
Gregorian calendar which was introduced in 1582 and not used
universally until the 20th century.  One of the re-interpretations
assumed by ISO 8601:2004 is that there was a year zero, even though
current year numbering (and zero) is a much later concept (525 AD for
year numbers from 1 AD).

If you want to extract specific aspects of a time (such as the day of
the week) just convert it to class \code{"POSIXlt"} and extract the
relevant component(s) of the list, or if you want a character
representation (such as a named day of the week) use the
\code{\LinkA{format}{format}} method.

If a timezone is needed and that specified is invalid on your system,
what happens is system-specific but attempts to set it will probably
be ignored.

%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] an object
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
Function \code{I} has two main uses.
\begin{itemize}

\item In function \code{\LinkA{data.frame}{data.frame}}.  Protecting an object by
enclosing it in \code{I()} in a call to \code{data.frame} inhibits the
conversion of character vectors to factors and the dropping of
names, and ensures that matrices are inserted as single columns.
\code{I} can also be used to protect objects which are to be
added to a data frame, or converted to a data frame \emph{via}
\code{\LinkA{as.data.frame}{as.data.frame}}.

It achieves this by prepending the class \code{"AsIs"} to the object's
classes.  Class \code{"AsIs"} has a few of its own methods, including
for \code{[}, \code{as.data.frame}, \code{print} and \code{format}.

\item In function \code{\LinkA{formula}{formula}}.  There it is used to
inhibit the interpretation of  operators such as \code{"+"},
\code{"-"}, \code{"*"} and \code{"\textasciicircum{}"} as formula operators, so they
are used as arithmetical operators.  This is interpreted as a symbol
by \code{terms.formula}.

assign(x, value, pos = -1, envir = as.environment(pos),
       inherits = FALSE, immediate = TRUE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] a variable name, given as a character string.  No coercion is
done, and the first element of a character vector of length greater
than one will be used, with a warning.
\item[\code{value}] a value to be assigned to \code{x}.
\item[\code{pos}] where to do the assignment.  By default, assigns into the
current environment.  See `Details' for other possibilities.
\item[\code{envir}] the \code{\LinkA{environment}{environment}} to use.  See `Details'.
\item[\code{inherits}] should the enclosing frames of the environment be
inspected?
\item[\code{immediate}] an ignored compatibility feature.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
There are no restrictions on \code{name}: it can be a non-syntactic
name (see \code{\LinkA{make.names}{make.names}}).

The \code{pos} argument can specify the  environment in which to assign
the object in any of several ways:
as an integer (the position in the \code{\LinkA{search}{search}} list); as
the character string name of an element in the search list; or as an
\code{\LinkA{environment}{environment}} (including using \code{\LinkA{sys.frame}{sys.frame}} to
access the currently active function calls).
The \code{envir} argument is an alternative way to specify an
environment, but is primarily there for back compatibility.

\code{assign} does not dispatch assignment methods, so it cannot be
used to set elements of vectors, names, attributes, etc.

Note that assignment to an attached list or data frame changes the
attached copy and not the original object: see \code{\LinkA{attach}{attach}}
and \code{\LinkA{with}{with}}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
This function is invoked for its side effect, which is assigning
\code{value} to the variable \code{x}.  If no \code{envir} is
specified, then the assignment takes place in the currently active
environment.

If \code{inherits} is \code{TRUE}, enclosing environments of the supplied
environment are searched until the variable \code{x} is encountered.
The value is then assigned in the environment in which the variable is
encountered (provided that the binding is not locked: see
\code{\LinkA{lockBinding}{lockBinding}}: if it is, an error is signaled).  If the
symbol is not encountered then assignment takes place in the user's
workspace (the global environment).

If \code{inherits} is \code{FALSE}, assignment takes place in the
initial frame of \code{envir}, unless an existing binding is locked or
there is no existing binding and the environment is locked.

\begin{Details}\relax
There are three different assignment operators: two of them
have leftwards and rightwards forms.

The operators \code{<-} and \code{=} assign into the environment in
which they are evaluated.  The  operator \code{<-} can be used
anywhere, whereas the operator \code{=} is only allowed at the top
level (e.g., in the complete expression typed at the command prompt)
or as one of the subexpressions in a braced list of expressions.

The operators \code{<{}<-} and \code{->{}>} are normally only used in
functions, and cause a search to made through parent environments
for an existing definition of the variable being assigned.  If such
a variable is found (and its binding is not locked) then its value
is redefined, otherwise assignment takes place in the global
environment.  Note that their semantics differ from that in the S
language, but are useful in conjunction with the scoping rules of
\R{}.  See `The R Language Definition' manual for further
details and examples.

In all the assignment operator expressions, \code{x} can be a name
or an expression defining a part of an object to be replaced (e.g.,
\code{z[[1]]}).  A syntactic name does not need to be quoted,
though it can be (preferably by \LinkA{backtick}{backtick}s).

The leftwards forms of assignment \code{<- = <{}<-} group right to left,
the other from left to right.

\item[\code{pos}] integer specifying position in \code{\LinkA{search}{search}()} where

printed about \code{\LinkA{conflicts}{conflicts}} from attaching the database,
unless that database contains an object \code{.conflicts.OK}.  A
conflict is a function masking a function, or a non-function masking
a non-function.

\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
When evaluating a variable or function name \R{} searches for
that name in the databases listed by \code{\LinkA{search}{search}}.  The first
name of the appropriate type is used.

By attaching a data frame (or list) to the search path it is possible
to refer to the variables in the data frame by their names alone,
rather than as components of the data frame (e.g. in the example below,
\code{height} rather than \code{women\$height}).

By default the database is attached in position 2 in the search path,
immediately after the user's workspace and before all previously
attached packages and previously attached databases.  This can be
altered to attach later in the search path with the \code{pos} option,
but you cannot attach at \code{pos = 1}.

The database is not actually attached.  Rather, a new environment is
created on the search path and the elements of a list (including
columns of a data frame) or objects in a save file or an environment
are \emph{copied} into the new environment.  If you use
\code{\LinkA{<{}<-}{<<.Rdash.}} or \code{\LinkA{assign}{assign}} to assign to an attached
database, you only alter the attached copy, not the original object.
(Normal assignment will place a modified version in the user's
workspace: see the examples.)  For this reason \code{attach} can lead
to confusion.

One useful `trick' is to use \code{what = NULL} (or equivalently a
length-zero list) to create a new environment on the search path into
which objects can be assigned by \code{\LinkA{assign}{assign}} or
\code{\LinkA{load}{load}} or \code{\LinkA{sys.source}{sys.source}}.

Names starting \code{"package:"} are reserved for
\code{\LinkA{library}{library}} and should not be used by end users. Attached
files are by default given the name \code{file:\var{what}}.  The
\code{name} argument given for the attached environment will be used
by \code{\LinkA{search}{search}} and can be used as the argument to
\code{\LinkA{as.environment}{as.environment}}.

There are hooks to attach user-defined table objects of class
\code{"UserDefinedDatabase"}, supported by the Omegahat package
\pkg{RObjectTables}.  See \url{http://www.omegahat.org/RObjectTables/}.

The extraction function first looks for an exact match to \code{which}
amongst the attributes of \code{x}, then (unless \code{exact = TRUE})
a unique partial match.
(Setting \code{\LinkA{options}{options}(warnPartialMatchAttr=TRUE)} causes
partial matches to give warnings.)

The replacement function only uses exact matches.

Note that some attributes (namely \code{\LinkA{class}{class}},
\code{\LinkA{comment}{comment}}, \code{\LinkA{dim}{dim}}, \code{\LinkA{dimnames}{dimnames}},
\code{\LinkA{names}{names}}, \code{\LinkA{row.names}{row.names}} and
\code{\LinkA{tsp}{tsp}}) are treated specially and have restrictions on
the values which can be set.  (Note that this is not true of
\code{\LinkA{levels}{levels}} which should be set for factors via the
\code{levels} replacement function.)

The extractor function allows (and does not match) empty and missing
values of \code{which}: the replacement function does not.

Both are \LinkA{primitive}{primitive} functions.

%
\begin{Details}\relax
Unlike \code{\LinkA{attr}{attr}} it is possible to set attributes on a
\code{NULL} object: it will first be coerced to an empty list.

Note that some attributes (namely \code{\LinkA{class}{class}},
\code{\LinkA{comment}{comment}}, \code{\LinkA{dim}{dim}}, \code{\LinkA{dimnames}{dimnames}},
\code{\LinkA{names}{names}}, \code{\LinkA{row.names}{row.names}} and
\code{\LinkA{tsp}{tsp}}) are treated specially and have restrictions on
the values which can be set.  (Note that this is not true of
\code{\LinkA{levels}{levels}} which should be set for factors via the
\code{levels} replacement function.)

Attributes are not stored internally as a list and should be thought
of as a set and not a vector.  They must have unique
names (and \code{NA} is taken as \code{"NA"}, not a missing value).

Assigning attributes first removes all attributes, then sets any
\code{dim} attribute and then the remaining attributes in the order
given: this ensures that setting a \code{dim} attribute always precedes
the \code{dimnames} attribute.

The \code{mostattributes} assignment takes special care for the
\code{\LinkA{dim}{dim}}, \code{\LinkA{names}{names}} and \code{\LinkA{dimnames}{dimnames}}
attributes, and assigns them only when known to be valid whereas an
\code{attributes} assignment would give an error if any are not.  It
is principally intended for arrays, and should be used with care on
classed objects.  For example, it does not check that
\code{\LinkA{row.names}{row.names}} are assigned correctly for data frames.

The names of a pairlist are not stored as attributes, but are reported
as if they were (and can be set by the replacement form of
\code{attributes}).

Both assignment and replacement forms of \code{attributes} are
\LinkA{primitive}{primitive} functions.

These functions represent an experimental interface for adjustments

a variable to a function.
\end{Description}

\begin{verbatim}
lockEnvironment(env, bindings = FALSE)

\item[\code{bindings}] logical specifying whether bindings should be locked.
\item[\code{sym}] a name object or character string
\item[\code{fun}] a function taking zero or one arguments
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The function \code{lockEnvironment} locks its environment argument,
which must be a normal environment (not base).  (Locking the base
environment and namespace may be supported later.)  Locking the
environment prevents adding or removing variable bindings from the
environment.  Changing the value of a variable is still possible unless
the binding has been locked.  The namespace environments of packages
with namespaces are locked when loaded.

\code{lockBinding} locks individual bindings in the specified
environment.  The value of a locked binding cannot be changed.  Locked
bindings may be removed from an environment unless the environment is
locked.

\code{makeActiveBinding} installs \code{fun} so that getting the value
of \code{sym} calls \code{fun} with no arguments, and assigning to
\code{sym} calls \code{fun} with one argument, the value to be
assigned.  This allows the implementation of things like C variables
linked to \R{} variables and variables linked to databases.  It may also
be useful for making thread-safe versions of some system globals.
\end{Details}

\begin{Value}
The \code{*isLocked} functions return a length-one logical vector.  The

browser(text="", condition=NULL, expr=TRUE, skipCalls=0L)

%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{text}] a text string that can be retrieved once the browser is invoked.
\item[\code{condition}] a condition that can be retrieved once the browser is
invoked.
\item[\code{expr}] An expression, which if it evaluates to \code{TRUE} the
debugger will invoked, otherwise control is returned directly.
\item[\code{skipCalls}] how many previous calls to skip when reporting the
calling context.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
A call to \code{browser} can be included in the body of a function.
When reached, this causes a pause in the execution of the
current expression and allows access to the \R{} interpreter.

The purpose of the \code{text} and \code{condition} arguments are to
allow helper programs (e.g. external debuggers) to insert specific
values here, so that the specific call to browser (perhaps its location
in a source file) can be identified and special processing can be
achieved.  The values can be retrieved by calling \code{\LinkA{browserText}{browserText}}
and \code{\LinkA{browserCondition}{browserCondition}}.

The purpose of the \code{expr} argument is to allow for the illusion
of conditional debugging. It is an illusion, because execution is
always paused at the call to browser, but control is only passed
to the evaluator described below if \code{expr} evaluates to \code{TRUE}.
In most cases it is going to be more efficient to use an \code{if}
statement in the calling program, but in some cases using this argument
will be simpler.

The \code{skipCalls} argument should be used when the \code{browser()}
call is nested within another debugging function:  it will look further
up the call stack to report its location.

At the browser prompt the user can enter commands or \R{} expressions,
followed by a newline.  The commands are

\begin{description}

\item[\code{c}] (or just an empty line, by default) exit the browser
and continue execution at the next statement.
\item[\code{cont}] synonym for \code{c}.
\item[\code{n}] enter the step-through debugger if the function is
interpreted.  This changes the meaning of \code{c}: see the
documentation for \code{\LinkA{debug}{debug}}. For byte compiled functions
\code{n} is equivalent to \code{c}.
\item[\code{where}] print a stack trace of all active function calls.
\item[\code{Q}] exit the browser and the current evaluation and
return to the top-level prompt.

\end{description}

(Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored, except for an empty line).

Anything else entered at the browser prompt is interpreted as an
\R{} expression to be evaluated in the calling environment: in
particular typing an object name will cause the object to be printed,
and \code{ls()} lists the objects in the calling frame.  (If you want
to look at an object with a name such as \code{n}, print it
explicitly.)

The number of lines printed for the deparsed call can be limited by
setting \code{\LinkA{options}{options}(deparse.max.lines)}.

Setting \LinkA{option}{options} \code{"browserNLdisabled"} to \code{TRUE}
disables the use of an empty line as a synonym for \code{c}.  If this
is done, the user will be re-prompted for input until a valid command
or an expression is entered.

This is a primitive function but does argument matching in the
standard way.

%
\begin{Description}\relax
A call to browser can provide context by supplying either a text
argument or a condition argument.  These functions can be used to
retrieve either of these arguments.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
browserText(n=1)
browserCondition(n=1)
browserSetDebug(n=1)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{n}] The number of contexts to skip over, it must be non-negative.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
Each call to \code{browser} can supply either a text string or a condition.
The functions \code{browserText} and \code{browserCondition} provide ways
to retrieve those values.  Since there can be multiple browser contexts
active at any time we also support retrieving values from the different
contexts.  The innermost (most recently initiated) browser context is 
numbered 1: other contexts are numbered sequentially.

\code{browserSetDebug} provides a mechanism for initiating the browser in
one of the calling functions.  See \code{\LinkA{sys.frame}{sys.frame}} for a more
complete discussion of the calling stack. To use \code{browserSetDebug} 
you select some calling function, determine how far back it is in the call
stack and call \code{browserSetDebug} with \code{n} set to that value. 
Then, by typing \code{c} at the browser prompt you will cause evaluation
to continue, and provided there are no intervening calls to browser or
other interrupts, control will halt again once evaluation has returned to
the closure specified.  This is similar to the up functionality in gdb
or the "step out" functionality in other debuggers.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{browserText} returns the text, while \code{browserCondition}
returns the condition from the specified browser context.

\code{browserSetDebug} returns NULL, invisibly.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
It may be of interest to allow for querying further up the set of browser
contexts and this functionality may be added at a later date.

This is a generic function which combines its arguments.

The default method combines its arguments to form a vector.
All arguments are coerced to a common type which is the type
of the returned value, and all attributes except names are removed.

%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}

\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{...}] objects to be concatenated.
\item[\code{recursive}] logical.  If \code{recursive = TRUE}, the function
recursively descends through lists (and pairlists) combining all
their elements into a vector.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The output type is determined from the highest type of the components
in the hierarchy NULL < raw < logical < integer < real < complex < character
< list < expression.  Pairlists are treated as lists, but non-vector
components (such names and calls) are treated as one-element lists
which cannot be unlisted even if \code{recursive = TRUE}.

\code{c} is sometimes used for its side effect of removing attributes
except names, for example to turn an array into a vector.
\code{as.vector} is a more intuitive way to do this, but also drops
names.  Note too that methods other than the default are not required
to do this (and they will almost certainly preserve a class attribute).

This is a \LinkA{primitive}{primitive} function.

\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{call} returns an unevaluated function call, that is, an
unevaluated expression which consists of the named function applied to
the given arguments (\code{name} must be a quoted string which gives
the name of a function to be called).  Note that although the call is
unevaluated, the arguments \code{...} are evaluated.

\code{call} is a primitive, so the first argument is
taken as \code{name} and the remaining arguments as arguments for the
constructed call: if the first argument is named the name must
partially match \code{name}.

\code{is.call} is used to determine whether \code{x} is a call (i.e.,
of mode \code{"call"}).

Objects of mode \code{"list"} can be coerced to mode \code{"call"}.
The first element of the list becomes the function part of the call,
so should be a function or the name of one (as a symbol; a quoted
string will not do).  

All three are \LinkA{primitive}{primitive} functions.  \code{call} is
`special': it only evaluates its first argument.

\item[\code{...}] arguments to be passed to the compiled code. Up to 65 for
\code{.Call}.

\item[\code{PACKAGE}] if supplied, confine the search for a character string
\code{.NAME} to the DLL given by this argument (plus the
conventional extension, \file{.so}, \file{.dll}, \dots).

This argument follows \code{...} and so its name cannot be abbreviated.

This is intended to add safety for packages, which can ensure by
using this argument that no other package can override their
external symbols, and also speeds up the search (see `Note').
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The functions are used to call compiled code which makes use of
internal \R{} objects, passing the arguments to the code as a sequence
of \R{} objects.  They assume C calling conventions, so can usually
also be used of C++ code.

For details about how to write code to use with these functions see
the chapter on ``System and foreign language interfaces'' in
the ``Writing \R{} Extensions'' manual.  They differ in the way the
arguments are passed to the C code:  \code{.External} allows for a
variable number of arguments.

These functions are \LinkA{primitive}{primitive}, and \code{.NAME} is always
matched to the first argument supplied (which should not be named and
there will be a warning if it is---and an error in future.).
For clarity, avoid using names in the arguments passed to \code{...}
that match or partially match \code{.NAME}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
An \R{} object constructed in the compiled code.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{Header files for external code}
Writing code for use with these functions will need to use internal \R{}
structures defined in \file{Rinternals.h} and/or the macros in
\file{Rdefines.h}.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
If one of these functions is to be used frequently, do specify
\code{PACKAGE} (to confine the search to a single DLL) or pass
\code{.NAME} as one of the native symbol objects.  Searching for
symbols can take a long time, especially when many namespaces are loaded.

You may see \code{PACKAGE = "base"} for symbols linked into \R{}.  Do
not use this in your own code: such symbols are not part of the API
and may be changed without warning.

\code{PACKAGE = ""} is accepted, but will become an error in \R{} 2.16.0.

cat(... , file = "", sep = " ", fill = FALSE, labels = NULL,
    append = FALSE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{...}] \R{} objects (see `Details' for the types of objects
allowed).
\item[\code{file}] A \LinkA{connection}{connection}, or a character string naming the file
to print to.  If \code{""} (the default), \code{cat} prints to the
standard output connection, the console unless redirected by
\code{\LinkA{sink}{sink}}.

\item[\code{sep}] a character vector of strings to append after each element.
\item[\code{fill}] a logical or (positive) numeric controlling how the output is
broken into successive lines.  If \code{FALSE} (default), only newlines
created explicitly by \samp{"\bsl{}n"} are printed.  Otherwise, the
output is broken into lines with print width equal to the option
\code{width} if \code{fill} is \code{TRUE}, or the value of
\code{fill} if this is numeric.  Non-positive \code{fill} values are
ignored, with a warning.
\item[\code{labels}] character vector of labels for the lines printed.
Ignored if \code{fill} is \code{FALSE}.
\item[\code{append}] logical. Only used if the argument \code{file} is the
name of file (and not a connection or \code{"|cmd"}).
If \code{TRUE} output will be appended to
\code{file}; otherwise, it will overwrite the contents of
\code{file}.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{cat} is useful for producing output in user-defined functions.
It converts its arguments to character vectors, concatenates
them to a single character vector, appends the given \code{sep=}
string(s) to each element and then outputs them.

No linefeeds are output unless explicitly requested by \samp{"\bsl{}n"}
or if generated by filling (if argument \code{fill} is \code{TRUE} or
numeric.)

If \code{file} is a connection and open for writing it is written from
its current position.  If it is not open, it is opened for the
duration of the call in \code{"wt"} mode and then closed again.

Currently only \LinkA{atomic}{atomic} vectors and \LinkA{name}{name}s are handled,
together with \code{NULL} and other zero-length objects (which produce
no output).  Character strings are output `as is' (unlike
\code{\LinkA{print.default}{print.default}} which escapes non-printable characters and
backslash --- use \code{\LinkA{encodeString}{encodeString}} if you want to output
encoded strings using \code{cat}).  Other types of \R{} object should be
converted (e.g. by \code{\LinkA{as.character}{as.character}} or \code{\LinkA{format}{format}})
before being passed to \code{cat}.

\code{cat} converts numeric/complex elements in the same way as
\code{print} (and not in the same way as \code{\LinkA{as.character}{as.character}}
which is used by the S equivalent), so \code{\LinkA{options}{options}}
\code{"digits"} and \code{"scipen"} are relevant.  However, it uses
the minimum field width necessary for each element, rather than the
same field width for all elements.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
None (invisible \code{NULL}).
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
If any element of \code{sep} contains a newline character, it is
treated as a vector of terminators rather than separators, an element
being output after every vector element \emph{and} a newline after the
last.  Entries are recycled as needed.

\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{...}] vectors or matrices.  These can be given as named
arguments.  Other \R{} objects will be coerced as appropriate: see
sections `Details' and `Value'.  (For the
\code{"data.frame"} method of \code{cbind} these can be further
arguments to \code{\LinkA{data.frame}{data.frame}} such as \code{stringsAsFactors}.)
\item[\code{deparse.level}] integer controlling the construction of labels in
the case of non-matrix-like arguments (for the default method):\\{}
\code{deparse.level = 0} constructs no labels; the default,
\code{deparse.level = 1 or 2} constructs labels from the argument
names, see the `Value' section below.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The functions \code{cbind} and \code{rbind} are S3 generic, with
methods for data frames.  The data frame method will be used if at
least one argument is a data frame and the rest are vectors or
matrices.  There can be other methods; in particular, there is one for
time series objects.  See the section on `Dispatch' for how
the method to be used is selected.

In the default method, all the vectors/matrices must be atomic (see
\code{\LinkA{vector}{vector}}) or lists.  Expressions are not allowed.
Language objects (such as formulae and calls) and pairlists will be
coerced to lists: other objects (such as names and external pointers)
will be included as elements in a list result.  Any classes the inputs
might have are discarded (in particular, factors are replaced by their
internal codes).

If there are several matrix arguments, they must all have the same
number of columns (or rows) and this will be the number of columns (or
rows) of the result.  If all the arguments are vectors, the number of
columns (rows) in the result is equal to the length of the longest
vector.  Values in shorter arguments are recycled to achieve this
length (with a \code{\LinkA{warning}{warning}} if they are recycled only
\emph{fractionally}).

When the arguments consist of a mix of matrices and vectors the number
of columns (rows) of the result is determined by the number of columns
(rows) of the matrix arguments.  Any vectors have their values
recycled or subsetted to achieve this length.

For \code{cbind} (\code{rbind}), vectors of zero length (including
\code{NULL}) are ignored unless the result would have zero rows
(columns), for S compatibility.
(Zero-extent matrices do not occur in S3 and are not ignored in \R{}.)
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
For the default method, a matrix combining the \code{...} arguments
column-wise or row-wise.  (Exception: if there are no inputs or all
the inputs are \code{NULL}, the value is \code{NULL}.)

The type of a matrix result determined from the highest type of any of
the inputs in the hierarchy raw < logical < integer < real < complex <
character < list .

For \code{cbind} (\code{rbind}) the column (row) names are taken from
the \code{colnames} (\code{rownames}) of the arguments if these are
matrix-like.  Otherwise from the names of the arguments or where those
are not supplied and \code{deparse.level > 0}, by deparsing the
expressions given, for \code{deparse.level = 1} only if that gives a
sensible name (a `symbol', see \code{\LinkA{is.symbol}{is.symbol}}).

For \code{cbind} row names are taken from the first argument with
appropriate names: rownames for a matrix, or names for a vector of
length the number of rows of the result.

For \code{rbind} column names are taken from the first argument with
appropriate names: colnames for a matrix, or names for a vector of
length the number of columns of the result.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{Data frame methods}
The \code{cbind} data frame method is just a wrapper for
\code{\LinkA{data.frame}{data.frame}(..., check.names = FALSE)}.  This means that
it will split matrix columns in data frame arguments, and convert
character columns to factors unless \code{stringsAsFactors = FALSE} is
specified.

The \code{rbind} data frame method first drops all zero-column and
zero-row arguments.  (If that leaves none, it returns the first
argument with columns otherwise a zero-column zero-row data frame.)
It then takes the classes of the columns from the
first data frame, and matches columns by name (rather than by
position).  Factors have their levels expanded as necessary (in the
order of the levels of the levelsets of the factors encountered) and
the result is an ordered factor if and only if all the components were
ordered factors.  (The last point differs from S-PLUS.)  Old-style
categories (integer vectors with levels) are promoted to factors.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Dispatch}
The method dispatching is \emph{not} done via
\code{\LinkA{UseMethod}{UseMethod}()}, but by C-internal dispatching.
Therefore there is no need for, e.g., \code{rbind.default}.

The dispatch algorithm is described in the source file
(\file{.../src/main/bind.c}) as

\begin{enumerate}

\item For each argument we get the list of possible class
memberships from the class attribute.

\item We inspect each class in turn to see if there is an
applicable method.

\item If we find an applicable method we make sure that it is
identical to any method determined for prior arguments.
If it is identical, we proceed, otherwise we immediately
drop through to the default code.

\end{enumerate}

If you want to combine other objects with data frames, it may be
necessary to coerce them to data frames first.  (Note that this
algorithm can result in calling the data frame method if all the
arguments are either data frames or vectors, and this will result in
the coercion of character vectors to factors.)

%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{as.character} and \code{is.character} are generic: you can
write methods to handle specific classes of objects,
see \LinkA{InternalMethods}{InternalMethods}.  Further, for \code{as.character} the
default method calls \code{\LinkA{as.vector}{as.vector}}, so dispatch is first on
methods for \code{as.character} and then for methods for \code{as.vector}.

\code{as.character} represents real and complex numbers to 15 significant
digits (technically the compiler's setting of the ISO C constant
\code{DBL\_DIG}, which will be 15 on machines supporting IEC60559
arithmetic according to the C99 standard).  This ensures that all the
digits in the result will be reliable (and not the result of
representation error), but does mean that conversion to character and
back to numeric may change the number.  If you want to convert numbers
to character with the maximum possible precision, use
\code{\LinkA{format}{format}}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{character} creates a character vector of the specified length.
The elements of the vector are all equal to \code{""}.

\code{as.character} attempts to coerce its argument to character type;
like \code{\LinkA{as.vector}{as.vector}} it strips attributes including names.
For lists it deparses the elements individually, except that it
extracts the first element of length-one character vectors.

\code{is.character} returns \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} depending on
whether its argument is of character type or not.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
\code{as.character} breaks lines in language objects at 500

\item[\code{x}] an object for which a method exists.  The default method
applies to real symmetric, positive-definite matrices.
\item[\code{...}] arguments to be based to or from methods.
\item[\code{pivot}] Should pivoting be used?
\item[\code{LINPACK}] logical.  Should LINPACK be used? (For compatibility
with \R{} < 1.7.0 in the non-pivoting case.)
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{chol} is generic: the description here applies to the default
method.

Note that only the upper triangular part of \code{x} is used, so
that \eqn{R'R = x}{} when \code{x} is symmetric.

If \code{pivot = FALSE} and \code{x} is not non-negative definite an
error occurs.  If \code{x} is positive semi-definite (i.e., some zero
eigenvalues) an error will also occur as a numerical tolerance is used.

If \code{pivot = TRUE}, then the Choleski decomposition of a positive
semi-definite \code{x} can be computed.  The rank of \code{x} is
returned as \code{attr(Q, "rank")}, subject to numerical errors.
The pivot is returned as \code{attr(Q, "pivot")}.  It is no longer
the case that \code{t(Q) \%*\% Q} equals \code{x}.  However, setting
\code{pivot <- attr(Q, "pivot")} and \code{oo <- order(pivot)}, it
is true that \code{t(Q[, oo]) \%*\% Q[, oo]} equals \code{x},
or, alternatively, \code{t(Q) \%*\% Q} equals \code{x[pivot,
  pivot]}.  See the examples.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
The upper triangular factor of the Choleski decomposition, i.e., the
matrix \eqn{R}{} such that \eqn{R'R = x}{} (see example).

If pivoting is used, then two additional attributes
\code{"pivot"} and \code{"rank"} are also returned.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{Warning}
The code does not check for symmetry.

If \code{pivot = TRUE} and \code{x} is not non-negative definite then
there will be a warning message but a meaningless result will occur.
So only use \code{pivot = TRUE} when \code{x} is non-negative definite
by construction.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
\code{LINPACK = TRUE, pivot = FALSE} (for compatibility with \R{} <
1.7.0) was formally deprecated in \R{} 2.15.2.

\begin{Description}\relax
\R{} possesses a simple generic function mechanism which can be used for
an object-oriented style of programming.  Method dispatch takes place
based on the class of the first argument to the generic function.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
class(x)
class(x) <- value
unclass(x)
inherits(x, what, which = FALSE)

oldClass(x)
oldClass(x) <- value
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] a \R{} object
\item[\code{what, value}] a character vector naming classes.  \code{value}
can also be \code{NULL}.
\item[\code{which}] logical affecting return value: see `Details'.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
Here, we describe the so called ``S3'' classes (and methods). For
``S4'' classes (and methods), see `Formal classes' below.

Many \R{} objects have a \code{class} attribute, a character vector
giving the names of the classes from which the object \emph{inherits}.
If the object does not have a class attribute, it has an implicit
class, \code{"matrix"}, \code{"array"} or the result of
\code{\LinkA{mode}{mode}(x)} (except that integer vectors have implicit class
\code{"integer"}).  (Functions \code{oldClass} and
\code{oldClass<-} get and set the attribute, which can also be done
directly.)

When a generic function \code{fun} is applied to an object with class
attribute \code{c("first", "second")}, the system searches for a
function called \code{fun.first} and, if it finds it, applies it to
the object.  If no such function is found, a function called
\code{fun.second} is tried.  If no class name produces a suitable
function, the function \code{fun.default} is used (if it exists).  If
there is no class attribute, the implicit class is tried, then the
default method.

The function \code{class} prints the vector of names of classes an
object inherits from.  Correspondingly, \code{class<-} sets the
classes an object inherits from.  Assigning \code{NULL} removes the
class attribute.

\code{unclass} returns (a copy of) its argument with its class
attribute removed.  (It is not allowed for objects which cannot be
copied, namely environments and external pointers.)

\code{inherits} indicates whether its first argument inherits from any
of the classes specified in the \code{what} argument.  If \code{which}
is \code{TRUE} then an integer vector of the same length as
\code{what} is returned.  Each element indicates the position in the
\code{class(x)} matched by the element of \code{what}; zero indicates
no match. If \code{which} is \code{FALSE} then \code{TRUE} is
returned by \code{inherits} if any of the names in \code{what} match
with any \code{class}.

All but \code{inherits} are \LinkA{primitive}{primitive} functions.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Section}{Formal classes}
An additional mechanism of \emph{formal} classes, nicknamed
``S4'', is available in package \pkg{methods} which is attached
by default.  For objects which have a formal class, its name is
returned by \code{class} as a character vector of length one and
method dispatch can happen on \emph{several} arguments, instead of
only the first.  However, S3 method selection attempts to treat objects
from an S4 class as if they had the appropriate S3 class attribute, as
does \code{inherits}.  Therefore, S3 methods can be defined for S4
classes.  See the `\LinkA{Classes}{Classes}' and `\LinkA{Methods}{Methods}'
help pages for details.

The replacement version of the function sets the class to the value
provided.  For classes that have a formal definition, directly
replacing the class this way is strongly deprecated.  The expression
\code{\LinkA{as}{as}(object, value)} is the way to coerce an object to a
particular class.

The analogue of \code{inherits} for formal classes is
\code{\LinkA{is}{is}}.  The two functions behave consistently
with one exception:  S4 classes can have conditional
inheritance, with an explicit test.  In this case, \code{is} will
test the condition, but \code{inherits} ignores all conditional
superclasses.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
Functions \code{oldClass} and \code{oldClass<-} behave in the same way
as functions of those names in S-PLUS 5/6, \emph{but} in \R{}
\code{\LinkA{UseMethod}{UseMethod}} dispatches on the class as returned by
\code{class} (with some interpolated classes: see the link) rather
than \code{oldClass}.  \emph{However}, \LinkA{group generic}{group generic}s dispatch
on the \code{oldClass} for efficiency, and \LinkA{internal generic}{internal generic}s
only dispatch on objects for which \code{\LinkA{is.object}{is.object}} is true.

In some versions of \R{}, assigning a zero-length vector with
\code{class} removes the class: in others it is an error (whereas it
works for \code{oldClass}.  It is clearer to always assign \code{NULL}
to remove the class.

The binary operator \code{:} has two meanings: for factors \code{a:b} is
equivalent to \code{\LinkA{interaction}{interaction}(a, b)} (but the levels are
ordered and labelled differently).

For other arguments \code{from:to} is equivalent to \code{seq(from, to)},
and generates a sequence from \code{from} to \code{to} in steps of \code{1}
or \code{-1}.  Value \code{to} will be included if it differs from
\code{from} by an integer up to a numeric fuzz of about \code{1e-7}.
Non-numeric arguments are coerced internally (hence without
dispatching methods) to numeric---complex values will have their
imaginary parts discarded with a warning.
\end{Details}

\begin{Value}
For numeric arguments, a numeric vector.  This will be of type
\code{\LinkA{integer}{integer}} if \code{from} is integer-valued and the result

\code{"double"} (aka \code{\LinkA{mode}{mode}} \code{"\LinkA{numeric}{numeric}"}).

These functions are equivalent to use of \code{\LinkA{apply}{apply}} with
\code{FUN = mean} or \code{FUN = sum} with appropriate margins, but
are a lot faster.  As they are written for speed, they blur over some
of the subtleties of \code{NaN} and \code{NA}.  If \code{na.rm =
    FALSE} and either \code{NaN} or \code{NA} appears in a sum, the
result will be one of \code{NaN} or \code{NA}, but which might be
platform-dependent.

Notice that omission of missing values is done on a per-column or
per-row basis, so column means may not be over the same set of rows,
and vice versa.  To use only complete rows or columns, first select
them with \code{\LinkA{na.omit}{na.omit}} or \code{\LinkA{complete.cases}{complete.cases}}
(possibly on the transpose of \code{x}). 

The versions with an initial dot in the name are `bare-bones'
versions for use in programming: they apply only to numeric matrices
and do not name the result.

\begin{Value}
A numeric or complex array of suitable size, or a vector if the result
is one-dimensional.  For the first four functions the \code{dimnames}

array.

If there are no values in a range to be summed over (after removing
missing values with \code{na.rm = TRUE}), that
component of the output is set to \code{0} (\code{*Sums}) or \code{NaN}
(\code{*Means}), consistent with \code{\LinkA{sum}{sum}} and

Binary operators which allow the comparison of values in atomic vectors.
\end{Description}

\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
x < y
x > y
x <= y
x >= y
x == y
x != y
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x, y}] atomic vectors, symbols, calls, or other objects for which
methods have been written.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The binary comparison operators are generic functions: methods can be
written for them individually or via the
\code{\LinkA{Ops}{S3groupGeneric}}) group generic function.  (See
\code{\LinkA{Ops}{S3groupGeneric}} for how dispatch is computed.)

Comparison of strings in character vectors is lexicographic within the
strings using the collating sequence of the locale in use: see
\code{\LinkA{locales}{locales}}.  The collating sequence of locales such as
\samp{en\_US} is normally different from \samp{C} (which should use
ASCII) and can be surprising.  Beware of making \emph{any} assumptions
about the collation order: e.g. in Estonian \code{Z} comes between
\code{S} and \code{T}, and collation is not necessarily
character-by-character -- in Danish \code{aa} sorts as a single
letter, after \code{z}.  In Welsh \code{ng} may or may not be a single
sorting unit: if it is it follows \code{g}.  Some platforms may
not respect the locale and always sort in numerical order of the bytes
in an 8-bit locale, or in Unicode point order for a UTF-8 locale (and
may not sort in the same order for the same language in different
character sets).  Collation of non-letters (spaces, punctuation signs,
hyphens, fractions and so on) is even more problematic.

Character strings can be compared  with different marked encodings
(see \code{\LinkA{Encoding}{Encoding}}): they are translated to UTF-8 before
comparison.

At least one of \code{x} and \code{y} must be an atomic vector, but if
the other is a list \R{} attempts to coerce it to the type of the atomic
vector: this will succeed if the list is made up of elements of length
one that can be coerced to the correct type.

If the two arguments are atomic vectors of different types, one is
coerced to the type of the other, the (decreasing) order of precedence
being character, complex, numeric, integer, logical and raw.

Missing values (\code{\LinkA{NA}{NA}}) and \code{\LinkA{NaN}{NaN}} values are
regarded as non-comparable even to themselves, so comparisons
involving them will always result in \code{NA}.  Missing values can
also result when character strings are compared and one is not valid
in the current collation locale. 

Language objects such as symbols and calls are deparsed to
character strings before comparison.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
A logical vector indicating the result of the element by element
comparison.  The elements of shorter vectors are recycled as
necessary.

Objects such as arrays or time-series can be compared this way
provided they are conformable.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{S4 methods}
These operators are members of the S4 \code{\LinkA{Compare}{Compare}} group generic,
and so methods can be written for them individually as well as for the
group generic (or the \code{Ops} group generic), with arguments
\code{c(e1, e2)}.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
Do not use \code{==} and \code{!=} for tests, such as in \code{if}
expressions, where you must get a single \code{TRUE} or
\code{FALSE}.  Unless you are absolutely sure that nothing unusual
can happen, you should use the \code{\LinkA{identical}{identical}} function
instead.

For numerical and complex values, remember \code{==} and \code{!=} do
not allow for the finite representation of fractions, nor for rounding
error.  Using \code{\LinkA{all.equal}{all.equal}} with \code{identical} is almost
always preferable.  See the examples.

\begin{Details}\relax
Complex vectors can be created with \code{complex}.  The vector can be
specified either by giving its length, its real and imaginary parts, or
modulus and argument.  (Giving just the length generates a vector of
complex zeroes.)

\code{as.complex} attempts to coerce its argument to be of complex
type: like \code{\LinkA{as.vector}{as.vector}} it strips attributes including
names.  All forms of \code{NA} and \code{NaN} are coerced to a complex
\code{NA}, for which both the real and imaginary parts are \code{NA}.

Note that \code{is.complex} and \code{is.numeric} are never both
\code{TRUE}.

The functions \code{Re}, \code{Im}, \code{Mod}, \code{Arg} and
\code{Conj} have their usual interpretation as returning the real
part, imaginary part, modulus, argument and complex conjugate for
complex values.  The modulus and argument are also called the \emph{polar
coordinates}.  If \eqn{z = x + i y}{} with real \eqn{x}{} and \eqn{y}{}, for
\eqn{r = Mod(z) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}{},
and \eqn{\phi = Arg(z)}{}, \eqn{x = r*\cos(\phi)}{} and
\eqn{y = r*\sin(\phi)}{}.  They are all
\LinkA{internal generic}{internal generic} \LinkA{primitive}{primitive} functions: methods can be
defined for them
individually or \emph{via} the \code{\LinkA{Complex}{S3groupGeneric}}
group generic.

In addition, the elementary trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential,
square root and hyperbolic functions are implemented for complex
values.

Internally, complex numbers are stored as a pair of \LinkA{double}{double}
precision numbers, either or both of which can be \code{\LinkA{NaN}{NaN}} or
plus or minus infinity.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Section}{S4 methods}
\code{as.complex} is primitive and can have S4 methods set.

\code{Re}, \code{Im}, \code{Mod}, \code{Arg} and \code{Conj}
constitute the S4 group generic
\code{\LinkA{Complex}{S4groupGeneric}} and so S4 methods can be
set for them individually or via the group generic.

\begin{Details}\relax

The condition system provides a mechanism for signaling and
handling unusual conditions, including errors and warnings.
Conditions are represented as objects that contain information
about the condition that occurred, such as a message and the call in
which the condition occurred.  Currently conditions are S3-style
objects, though this may eventually change.

Conditions are objects inheriting from the abstract class
\code{condition}.  Errors and warnings are objects inheriting
from the abstract subclasses \code{error} and \code{warning}.
The class \code{simpleError} is the class used by \code{stop}
and all internal error signals.  Similarly, \code{simpleWarning}
is used by \code{warning}, and \code{simpleMessage} is used by
\code{message}.  The constructors by the same names take a string
describing the condition as argument and an optional call.  The
functions \code{conditionMessage} and \code{conditionCall} are
generic functions that return the message and call of a condition.

Conditions are signaled by \code{signalCondition}.  In addition,
the \code{stop} and \code{warning} functions have been modified to
also accept condition arguments.

The function \code{tryCatch} evaluates its expression argument
in a context where the handlers provided in the \code{...}
argument are available.  The \code{finally} expression is then
evaluated in the context in which \code{tryCatch} was called; that
is, the handlers supplied to the current \code{tryCatch} call are
not active when the \code{finally} expression is evaluated.

Handlers provided in the \code{...} argument to \code{tryCatch}
are established for the duration of the evaluation of \code{expr}.
If no condition is signaled when evaluating \code{expr} then
\code{tryCatch} returns the value of the expression.

If a condition is signaled while evaluating \code{expr} then
established handlers are checked, starting with the most recently
established ones, for one matching the class of the condition.
When several handlers are supplied in a single \code{tryCatch} then
the first one is considered more recent than the second.  If a
handler is found then control is transferred to the
\code{tryCatch} call that established the handler, the handler
found and all more recent handlers are disestablished, the handler
is called with the condition as its argument, and the result
returned by the handler is returned as the value of the
\code{tryCatch} call.

Calling handlers are established by \code{withCallingHandlers}.  If
a condition is signaled and the applicable handler is a calling
handler, then the handler is called by \code{signalCondition} in
the context where the condition was signaled but with the available
handlers restricted to those below the handler called in the
handler stack.  If the handler returns, then the next handler is
tried; once the last handler has been tried, \code{signalCondition}
returns \code{NULL}.

User interrupts signal a condition of class \code{interrupt} that
inherits directly from class \code{condition} before executing the
default interrupt action.

Restarts are used for establishing recovery protocols.  They can be
established using \code{withRestarts}.  One pre-established restart is
an \code{abort} restart that represents a jump to top level.

\code{findRestart} and \code{computeRestarts} find the available
restarts.  \code{findRestart} returns the most recently established
restart of the specified name.  \code{computeRestarts} returns a
list of all restarts.  Both can be given a condition argument and
will then ignore restarts that do not apply to the condition.

\code{invokeRestart} transfers control to the point where the
specified restart was established and calls the restart's handler with the
arguments, if any, given as additional arguments to
\code{invokeRestart}.  The restart argument to \code{invokeRestart}
can be a character string, in which case \code{findRestart} is used
to find the restart.

New restarts for \code{withRestarts} can be specified in several ways.
The simplest is in \code{name=function} form where the function is
the handler to call when the restart is invoked.  Another simple
variant is as \code{name=string} where the string is stored in the
\code{description} field of the restart object returned by
\code{findRestart}; in this case the handler ignores its arguments
and returns \code{NULL}.  The most flexible form of a restart
specification is as a list that can include several fields, including
\code{handler}, \code{description}, and \code{test}.  The
\code{test} field should contain a function of one argument, a
condition, that returns \code{TRUE} if the restart applies to the
condition and \code{FALSE} if it does not; the default function
returns \code{TRUE} for all conditions.

One additional field that can be specified for a restart is
\code{interactive}.  This should be a function of no arguments that
returns a list of arguments to pass to the restart handler.  The list
could be obtained by interacting with the user if necessary.  The
function \code{invokeRestartInteractively} calls this function to
obtain the arguments to use when invoking the restart.  The default
\code{interactive} method queries the user for values for the
formal arguments of the handler function.

\code{.signalSimpleWarning} and \code{.handleSimpleError}
are used internally and should not be called directly.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{References}\relax
The \code{tryCatch} mechanism is similar to Java
error handling.  Calling handlers are based on Common Lisp and
Dylan.  Restarts are based on the Common Lisp restart mechanism.

supported.
\item[\code{filename}] a filename within a zip file.

`Clipboard' section).  Use \code{"stdin"} to refer to the
C-level `standard input' of the process (which need not be
connected to anything in a console or embedded version of \R{}, and is
not in \code{RGui} on Windows).  See also \code{\LinkA{stdin}{stdin}()} for
the subtly different R-level concept of \code{stdin}.

For \code{url} the description is a complete URL, including scheme
(such as \samp{http://}, \samp{ftp://} or \samp{file://}).  Proxies
can be specified for HTTP and FTP \code{url} connections: see
\code{\LinkA{download.file}{download.file}}.

For \code{gzfile} the description is the path to a file compressed by
\command{gzip}: it can also open for reading uncompressed files and
(as from \R{} 2.10.0) those compressed by \command{bzip2}, \command{xz}
or \command{lzma}.

For \code{bzfile} the description is the path to a file compressed by
\command{bzip2}.

For \code{xzfile} the description is the path to a file compressed by
\command{xz} (\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xz}) or (for reading
only) \command{lzma} (\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZMA}).

\code{unz} reads (only) single files within zip files, in binary mode.
The description is the full path to the zip file, with \file{.zip}
extension if required.

For \code{pipe} the description is the command line to be piped to or
from.  This is run in a shell, on Windows that specified by the
\env{COMSPEC} environment variable.

For \code{fifo} the description is the path of the fifo.  (Windows
does not have fifos, so attempts to use this function there are an
error.  It was possible to use \code{file} with fifos prior to \R{}
2.10.0, but \code{raw=TRUE} is now required for reading, and
\code{fifo} was always the documented interface.) 

All platforms support \code{file}, \code{pipe}, \code{gzfile},
\code{bzfile}, \code{xzfile}, \code{unz} and \code{url("file://")}
connections.  The other connections may be partially implemented or
not implemented at all.  (They do work on most Unix platforms, and all
but \code{fifo} on Windows.)

The intention is that \code{file} and \code{gzfile} can be used
generally for text input (from files and URLs) and binary input
respectively.

\code{open}, \code{close} and \code{seek} are generic functions: the
following applies to the methods relevant to connections.

\code{open} opens a connection.  In general functions using
connections will open them if they are not open, but then close them
again, so to leave a connection open call \code{open} explicitly.

\code{close} closes and destroys a connection.  This will happen
automatically in due course (with a warning) if there is no longer an
\R{} object referring to the connection.

A maximum of 128 connections can be allocated (not necessarily open)
at any one time.  Three of these are pre-allocated (see
\code{\LinkA{stdout}{stdout}}).   The OS will impose limits on the numbers of
connections of various types, but these are usually larger than 125.

\code{flush} flushes the output stream of a connection open for
write/append (where implemented, currently for file and clipboard
connections, \code{\LinkA{stdout}{stdout}} and \code{\LinkA{stderr}{stderr}}).

If for a \code{file} or \code{fifo} connection the description is
\code{""}, the file/fifo is immediately opened (in \code{"w+"} mode
unless \code{open = "w+b"} is specified) and unlinked from the file
system.  This provides a temporary file/fifo to write to and then read
from.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{file}, \code{pipe}, \code{fifo}, \code{url}, \code{gzfile},
\code{bzfile}, \code{xzfile}, \code{unz} and \code{socketConnection}
return a connection object which inherits from class
\code{"connection"} and has a first more specific class.

\code{isOpen} returns a logical value, whether the connection is
currently open.

\code{isIncomplete} returns a logical value, whether the last read
attempt was blocked, or for an output text connection whether there is
unflushed output.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{URLs}
\code{url} and \code{file} support URL schemes \samp{http://},
\samp{ftp://} and \samp{file://}.

A note on \samp{file://} URLs.  The most general form (from RFC1738) is
\samp{file://host/path/to/file}, but \R{} only accepts the form with an
empty \code{host} field referring to the local machine.

On a Unix-alike, this is then \samp{file:///path/to/file}, where
\samp{path/to/file} is relative to \file{/}.  So although the third
slash is strictly part of the specification not part of the path, this
can be regarded as a way to specify the file \file{/path/to/file}.  It
is not possible to specify a relative path using a file URL.

In this form the path is relative to the root of the filesystem, not a
Windows concept.  The standard form on Windows is
\samp{file:///d:/R/repos}: for compatibility with earlier versions of
\R{} and Unix versions, any other form is parsed as \R{} as \samp{file://}
plus \code{path\_to\_file}.  Also, backslashes are accepted within the
path even though RFC1738 does not allow them.

No attempt is made to decode an encoded URL: call
\code{\LinkA{URLdecode}{URLdecode}} if necessary.

Note that \samp{https://} connections are not supported except on
Windows.  There they are only supported if \option{--internet2} or
\code{\LinkA{setInternet2}{setInternet2}(TRUE)}
was used (to make use of Internet Explorer internals), and then only
if the certificate is considered to be valid.  With that option only,
the \samp{http://user:pass@site} notation for sites requiring
authentication is also accepted.

Contributed package \Rhref{http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RCurl}{\pkg{RCurl}} provides more comprehensive facilities
to download from URLs.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Modes}
Possible values for the argument \code{open} are
\begin{description}

\item[\code{"r"} or \code{"rt"}] Open for reading in text mode.
\item[\code{"w"} or \code{"wt"}] Open for writing in text mode.
\item[\code{"a"} or \code{"at"}] Open for appending in text mode.
\item[\code{"rb"}] Open for reading in binary mode.
\item[\code{"wb"}] Open for writing in binary mode.
\item[\code{"ab"}] Open for appending in binary mode.
\item[\code{"r+"}, \code{"r+b"}] Open for reading and writing.
\item[\code{"w+"}, \code{"w+b"}] Open for reading and writing,
truncating file initially.
\item[\code{"a+"}, \code{"a+b"}] Open for reading and appending.

\end{description}

Not all modes are applicable to all connections: for example URLs can
only be opened for reading.  Only file and socket connections can be
opened for both reading and writing.  An unsupported mode is usually
silently substituted.

If a file or fifo is created on a Unix-alike, its permissions will be
the maximal allowed by the current setting of \code{umask} (see
\code{\LinkA{Sys.umask}{Sys.umask}}).

For many connections there is little or no difference between text and
binary modes.  For file-like connections on Windows, translation of
line endings (between LF and CRLF) is done in text mode only (but text
read operations on connections such as \code{\LinkA{readLines}{readLines}},
\code{\LinkA{scan}{scan}} and \code{\LinkA{source}{source}} work for any form of line
ending).  Various \R{} operations are possible in only one of the modes:
for example \code{\LinkA{pushBack}{pushBack}} is text-oriented and is only
allowed on connections open for reading in text mode, and binary
operations such as \code{\LinkA{readBin}{readBin}}, \code{\LinkA{load}{load}} and
\code{\LinkA{save}{save}} operations can only be done on binary-mode
connections.

The mode of a connection is determined when actually opened, which is
deferred if \code{open = ""} is given (the default for all but socket
connections).  An explicit call to \code{open} can specify the mode,
but otherwise the mode will be \code{"r"}.  (\code{gzfile},
\code{bzfile} and \code{xzfile} connections are exceptions, as the
compressed file always has to be opened in binary mode and no
conversion of line-endings is done even on Windows, so the default
mode is interpreted as \code{"rb"}.)  Most operations that need write
access or text-only or binary-only mode will override the default mode
of a non-yet-open connection.

Append modes need to be considered carefully for compressed-file
connections.  They do \strong{not} produce a single compressed stream
on the file, but rather append a new compressed stream to the file.
Readers (including \R{}) may or may not read beyond end of the first
stream: currently \R{} does so for \code{gzfile}, \code{bzfile} and
\code{xzfile} connections, but earlier versions did not.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Compression}
\R{} has for a long time supported \command{gzip} and \command{bzip2}
compression, and support for \command{xz} compression (and read-only
support for its precursor \code{lzma} compression) was added in \R{}
2.10.0.

For reading, the type of compression (if any) can be determined from
the first few bytes of the file, and this is exploited as from \R{}
2.10.0.  Thus for \code{file(raw = FALSE)} connections, if \code{open} is
\code{""}, \code{"r"} or \code{"rt"} the connection can read any of
the compressed file types as well as uncompressed files.  (Using
\code{"rb"} will allow compressed files to be read byte-by-byte.)
Similarly, \code{gzfile} connections can read any of the forms of
compression and uncompressed files in any read mode.

(The type of compression is determined when the connection is created
if \code{open} is unspecified and a file of that name exists.  If the
intention is to open the connection to write a file with a
\emph{different} form of compression under that name, specify
\code{open = "w"} when the connection is created or
\code{\LinkA{unlink}{unlink}} the file before creating the connection.)

For write-mode connections, \code{compress} specifies how hard the
compressor works to minimize the file size, and higher values need
more CPU time and more working memory (up to ca 800Mb for
\code{xzfile(compress = 9)}).  For \code{xzfile} negative values of
\code{compress} correspond to adding the \command{xz} argument
\option{-e}: this takes more time (double?) to compress but may
achieve (slightly) better compression.  The default (\code{6}) has
good compression and modest (100Mb memory usage): but if you are using
\code{xz} compression you are probably looking for high compression.

Choosing the type of compression involves tradeoffs: \command{gzip},
\command{bzip2} and \command{xz} are successively less widely supported,
need more resources for both compression and decompression, and
achieve more compression (although individual files may buck the
general trend).  Typical experience is that \code{bzip2} compression
is 15\% better on text files than \code{gzip} compression, and
\code{xz} with maximal compression 30\% better.  The experience with
\R{} \code{\LinkA{save}{save}} files is similar, but on some large \file{.rda}
files \code{xz} compression is much better than the other two.  With
current computers decompression times even with \code{compress = 9}
are typically modest and reading compressed files is usually faster
than uncompressed ones because of the reduction in disc activity.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Encoding}
The encoding of the input/output stream of a connection can be
specified by name in the same way as it would be given to
\code{\LinkA{iconv}{iconv}}: see that help page for how to find out what
encoding names are recognized on your platform.  Additionally,
\code{""} and \code{"native.enc"} both mean the `native'
encoding, that is the internal encoding of the current locale and
hence no translation is done.

Re-encoding only works for connections in text mode: reading from a
connection with re-encoding specified in binary mode will read the
stream of bytes, but mixing text and binary mode reads (e.g. mixing
calls to \code{\LinkA{readLines}{readLines}} and \code{\LinkA{readChar}{readChar}}) is likely
to lead to incorrect results.

The encodings \code{"UCS-2LE"} and \code{"UTF-16LE"} are treated
specially, as they are appropriate values for Windows `Unicode'
text files.  If the first two bytes are the Byte Order Mark
\code{0xFFFE} then these are removed as some implementations of
\code{\LinkA{iconv}{iconv}} do not accept BOMs.  Note that whereas most
implementations will handle BOMs using encoding \code{"UCS-2"} and
choose the appropriate byte order, some (including earlier versions of
\code{glibc}) will not.  There is a subtle distinction between
\code{"UTF-16"} and \code{"UCS-2"} (see
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16/UCS-2}: the use of surrogate
pairs is very rare so \code{"UCS-2LE"} is an appropriate first choice.

Requesting a conversion that is not supported is an error, reported
when the connection is opened.  Exactly what happens when the
requested translation cannot be done for invalid input is in general
undocumented.  On output the result is likely to be that up to the
error, with a warning.  On input, it will most likely be all or some
of the input up to the error.

It may be possible to deduce the current native encoding from
\code{\LinkA{Sys.getlocale}{Sys.getlocale}("LC\_CTYPE")}, but not all OSes record it. 
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Blocking}
Whether or not the connection blocks can be specified for file, url
(default yes) fifo and socket connections (default not).

In blocking mode, functions using the connection do not return to the
\R{} evaluator until the read/write is complete.  In non-blocking mode,
operations return as soon as possible, so on input they will return
with whatever input is available (possibly none) and for output they
will return whether or not the write succeeded.

The function \code{\LinkA{readLines}{readLines}} behaves differently in respect of
incomplete last lines in the two modes: see its help page.

Even when a connection is in blocking mode, attempts are made to
ensure that it does not block the event loop and hence the operation
of GUI parts of \R{}.  These do not always succeed, and the whole \R{}
process will be blocked during a DNS lookup on Unix, for example.

Most blocking operations on HTTP/FTP URLs and on sockets are subject to the
timeout set by \code{options("timeout")}.  Note that this is a timeout
for no response, not for the whole operation.  The timeout is set at
the time the connection is opened (more precisely, when the last
connection of that type -- \samp{http:}, \samp{ftp:} or socket -- was
opened).
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Fifos}
Fifos default to non-blocking.  That follows S version 4 and is
probably most natural, but it does have some implications.  In
particular, opening a non-blocking fifo connection for writing (only)
will fail unless some other process is reading on the fifo.

Opening a fifo for both reading and writing (in any mode: one can only
append to fifos) connects both sides of the fifo to the \R{} process,
and provides an similar facility to \code{file()}.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Clipboard}
\code{file} can be used with \code{description = "clipboard"}
in modes \code{"r"} and \code{"w"} only.

When a clipboard is opened for reading, the contents are immediately
copied to internal storage in the connection.

When writing to the clipboard, the output is copied to the clipboard
only when the connection is closed or flushed.  There is a 32Kb limit
on the text to be written to the clipboard.  This can be raised by
using e.g. \code{file("clipboard-128")} to give 128Kb.

The clipboard works in Unicode wide characters, so encodings might
not work as one might expect.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
\R{}'s connections are modelled on those in S version 4 (see Chambers,
1998).  However \R{} goes well beyond the S model, for example in output
text connections and URL, compressed and socket connections.

The default open mode in \R{} is \code{"r"} except for socket connections.
This differs from S, where it is the equivalent of \code{"r+"},
known as \code{"*"}.

On (rare) platforms where \code{vsnprintf} does not return the needed length
of output there is a 100,000 byte output limit on the length of
line for text output on \code{fifo}, \code{gzfile}, \code{bzfile} and
\code{xzfile} connections: longer lines will be truncated with a
warning.

if possible, ignoring any class.

\item[\code{seq}] An expression evaluating to a vector (including a list and
an \LinkA{expression}{expression}) or to a \LinkA{pairlist}{pairlist} or \code{NULL}.  A
factor value will be coerced to a character vector.
\item[\code{expr, cons.expr, alt.expr}] 
An \emph{expression} in a formal sense.  This is either a
simple expression or a so called \emph{compound expression}, usually
of the form \code{\{ expr1 ; expr2 \}}.

\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{break} breaks out of a \code{for}, \code{while} or \code{repeat}
loop; control is transferred to the first statement outside the
inner-most loop. \code{next} halts the processing of the current
iteration and advances the looping index.  Both \code{break} and
\code{next} apply only to the innermost of nested loops.

Note that it is a common mistake to forget to put braces (\code{\{ .. \}})
around your statements, e.g., after \code{if(..)} or \code{for(....)}.
In particular, you should not have a newline between \code{\}} and 
\code{else} to avoid a syntax error in entering a \code{if ... else}
construct at the keyboard or via \code{source}.
For that reason, one (somewhat extreme) attitude of defensive programming
is to always use braces, e.g., for \code{if} clauses.

The \code{seq} in a \code{for} loop is evaluated at the start of
the loop; changing it subsequently does not affect the loop.  If
\code{seq} has length zero the body of the loop is skipped. Otherwise the
variable \code{var} is assigned in turn the value of each element of
\code{seq}. You can assign to \code{var} within the body of the loop,
but this will not affect the next iteration.  When the loop terminates,
\code{var} remains as a variable containing its latest value.

\begin{Description}\relax
\strong{Warning}: these functions are deprecated and will be removed
shortly.  Use the \code{\LinkA{.Call}{.Call}} interface instead.

These functions provide facilities to manage the extensible
list of converters used to translate R objects to C
pointers for use in \code{\LinkA{.C}{.C}} calls.
The number and a description of each element in the list 
can be retrieved. One can also query and set the activity
status of individual elements, temporarily ignoring them.
And one can remove individual elements.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
getNumCConverters()
getCConverterDescriptions()
getCConverterStatus()
setCConverterStatus(id, status)
removeCConverter(id)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{id}] either a number or a string identifying the element of
interest in the converter list.  A string is matched against the
description strings for each element to identify the element.
Integers are specified starting at 1 (rather than 0).

\item[\code{status}] a logical value specifying whether the element is to be considered
active (\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}).
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The internal list of converters is potentially used when converting
individual arguments in a \code{\LinkA{.C}{.C}} call.  If an argument has a
non-trivial class attribute, we iterate over the list of converters
looking for the first that matches.  If we find a matching
converter, we have it create the C-level pointer corresponding to the
R object.  When the call to the C routine is complete, we use the same
converter for that argument to reverse the conversion and create an R
object from the current value in the C pointer.  This is done
separately for all the arguments.

The functions documented here provide \R{} user-level capabilities
for investigating and managing the list of converters.
There is currently no mechanism for adding an element to the
converter list within the \R{} language.  This must be done in
C code using the routine \code{R\_addToCConverter()}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{getNumCConverters} returns an integer giving the number
of elements in the list, both active and inactive.

\code{getCConverterDescriptions} returns a character vector containing
the description string of each element of the converter list.

\code{getCConverterStatus} returns a logical vector with a value for
each element in the converter list.  Each value indicates whether that
converter is active (\code{TRUE}) or inactive (\code{FALSE}).
The names of the elements are the description strings returned
by \code{getCConverterDescriptions}.

\code{setCConverterStatus} returns the logical value indicating the
activity status of the specified element before the call to change it
took effect.  This is \code{TRUE} for active and \code{FALSE} for
inactive.

\code{removeCConverter} returns \code{TRUE} if
an element in the converter list was identified and removed.
In the case that no such element was found, an error occurs.

%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
Cstack_info()
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
On most platforms, C stack information is recorded when \R{} is
initialized and used for stack-checking.  If this information is
unavailable, the \code{size} will be returned as \code{NA}, and
stack-checking is not performed.

The information on the stack base address is thought to be accurate on
Windows, Linux and FreeBSD (including Mac OS X), but a heuristic is
used on other platforms.  Because this might be slightly inaccurate,
the current usage could be estimated as negative.  (The heuristic is
not used on embedded uses of \R{} on platforms where the stack base
is not thought to be accurate.)

\begin{Description}\relax
\code{cut} divides the range of \code{x} into intervals
and codes the values in \code{x} according to which
interval they fall.  The leftmost interval corresponds to level one,
the next leftmost to level two and so on.

## Default S3 method:
cut(x, breaks, labels = NULL,

    ordered_result = FALSE, ...)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] a numeric vector which is to be converted to a factor by cutting.
\item[\code{breaks}] either a numeric vector of two or more unique cut points or a
single number (greater than or equal to 2) giving the number of
intervals into which \code{x} is to be cut.
\item[\code{labels}] labels for the levels of the resulting category.  By default,
labels are constructed using \code{"(a,b]"} interval notation.  If
\code{labels = FALSE}, simple integer codes are returned instead of
a factor.
\item[\code{include.lowest}] logical, indicating if an `x[i]' equal to
the lowest (or highest, for \code{right = FALSE}) `breaks'
value should be included.
\item[\code{right}] logical, indicating if the intervals should be closed on
the right (and open on the left) or vice versa.
\item[\code{dig.lab}] integer which is used when labels are not given.  It
determines the number of digits used in formatting the break numbers.
\item[\code{ordered\_result}] logical: should the result be an ordered factor?
\item[\code{...}] further arguments passed to or from other methods.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
When \code{breaks} is specified as a single number, the range of the
data is divided into \code{breaks} pieces of equal length, and then
the outer limits are moved away by 0.1\% of the range to ensure that
the extreme values both fall within the break intervals.  (If \code{x}
is a constant vector, equal-length intervals are created, one of
which includes the single value.)

If a \code{labels} parameter is specified, its values are used
to name the factor levels.  If none is specified, the factor
level labels are constructed as \code{"(b1, b2]"}, \code{"(b2, b3]"}
etc. for \code{right = TRUE} and as \code{"[b1, b2)"}, \ldots if
\code{right = FALSE}.
In this case, \code{dig.lab} indicates the minimum number  of digits
should be used in formatting the numbers \code{b1}, \code{b2}, \ldots.
A larger value (up to 12) will be used if needed to distinguish
between any pair of  endpoints: if this fails labels such as
\code{"Range3"} will be used.

The default method will sort a numeric vector of \code{breaks}, but
other methods are not required to and \code{labels} will correspond to
the intervals after sorting.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
A \code{\LinkA{factor}{factor}} is returned, unless \code{labels = FALSE} which
results in an integer vector of level codes.

Values which fall outside the range of \code{breaks} are coded as
\code{NA}, as are \code{NaN} and \code{NA} values.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
Instead of \code{table(cut(x, br))}, \code{hist(x, br, plot = FALSE)} is
more efficient and less memory hungry.  Instead of \code{cut(*,
    labels = FALSE)}, \code{\LinkA{findInterval}{findInterval}()} is more efficient.

\begin{Details}\relax
A data frame is a list of variables of the same number of rows with
unique row names, given class \code{"data.frame"}.  If no variables
are included, the row names determine the number of rows.

The column names should be non-empty, and attempts to use empty names
will have unsupported results.  Duplicate column names are allowed,
but you need to use \code{check.names = FALSE} for \code{data.frame}
to generate such a data frame.  However, not all operations on data
frames will preserve duplicated column names: for example matrix-like
subsetting will force column names in the result to be unique.

\code{data.frame} converts each of its arguments to a data frame by
calling \code{\LinkA{as.data.frame}{as.data.frame}(optional=TRUE)}.  As that is a
generic function, methods can be written to change the behaviour of
arguments according to their classes: \R{} comes with many such methods.
Character variables passed to \code{data.frame} are converted to
factor columns unless protected by \code{\LinkA{I}{I}} or argument
\code{stringsAsFactors} is false.  If a list or data
frame or matrix is passed to \code{data.frame} it is as if each
component or column had been passed as a separate argument (except for
matrices of class \code{"\LinkA{model.matrix}{model.matrix}"} and those protected by
\code{\LinkA{I}{I}}).

Objects passed to \code{data.frame} should have the same number of
rows, but atomic vectors, factors and character vectors protected by
\code{\LinkA{I}{I}} will be recycled a whole number of times if necessary
(including as elements of list arguments).

If row names are not supplied in the call to \code{data.frame}, the
row names are taken from the first component that has suitable names,
for example a named vector or a matrix with rownames or a data frame.
(If that component is subsequently recycled, the names are discarded
with a warning.)  If \code{row.names} was supplied as \code{NULL} or no
suitable component was found the row names are the integer sequence
starting at one (and such row names are considered to be
`automatic', and not preserved by \code{\LinkA{as.matrix}{as.matrix}}).

If row names are supplied of length one and the data frame has a
single row, the \code{row.names} is taken to specify the row names and
not a column (by name or number).

Names are removed from vector inputs not protected by \code{\LinkA{I}{I}}.

\code{default.stringsAsFactors} is a utility that takes
\code{\LinkA{getOption}{getOption}("stringsAsFactors")} and ensures the result is
\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} (or throws an error if the value is not
\code{NULL}).
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
A data frame, a matrix-like structure whose columns may be of
differing types (numeric, logical, factor and character and so on).

How the names of the data frame are created is complex, and the rest
of this paragraph is only the basic story.  If the arguments are all
named and simple objects (not lists, matrices of data frames) then the
argument names give the column names.  For an unnamed simple argument,
a deparsed version of the argument is used as the name (with an
enclosing \code{I(...)} removed).  For a named matrix/list/data frame
argument with more than one named column, the names of the columns are
the name of the argument followed by a dot and the column name inside
the argument: if the argument is unnamed, the argument's column names
are used.  For a named or unnamed matrix/list/data frame argument that
contains a single column, the column name in the result is the column
name in the argument.  Finally, the names are adjusted to be unique
and syntactically valid unless \code{check.names = FALSE}.
\end{Value}

\begin{Note}\relax
In versions of \R{} prior to 2.4.0 \code{row.names} had to be
character: to ensure compatibility with such versions of \R{}, supply
a character vector as the \code{row.names} argument.

Dates are represented as the number of days since 1970-01-01, with
negative values for earlier dates.  They are always printed
following the rules of the current Gregorian calendar, even though
that calendar was not in use long ago (it was adopted in 1752 in
Great Britain and its colonies).

It is intended that the date should be an integer, but this is not
enforced in the internal representation.  Fractional days will be
ignored when printing.  It is possible to produce fractional days via
the \code{mean} method or by adding or subtracting (see
\code{\LinkA{Ops.Date}{Ops.Date}}).

\begin{Details}\relax
There are two basic classes of date/times.  Class \code{"POSIXct"}
represents the (signed) number of seconds since the beginning of 1970
(in the UTC timezone) as a numeric vector.  Class \code{"POSIXlt"} is
a named list of vectors representing
\begin{description}

\item[\code{sec}] 0--61: seconds
\item[\code{min}] 0--59: minutes
\item[\code{hour}] 0--23: hours
\item[\code{mday}] 1--31: day of the month
\item[\code{mon}] 0--11: months after the first of the year.
\item[\code{year}] years since 1900.
\item[\code{wday}] 0--6 day of the week, starting on Sunday.
\item[\code{yday}] 0--365: day of the year.
\item[\code{isdst}] Daylight Savings Time flag.  Positive if in
force, zero if not, negative if unknown.

\end{description}

Note that the internal list structure is somewhat hidden, as many
methods, including \code{\LinkA{print}{print}()} or \code{\LinkA{str}{str}}, apply
to the abstract date-time vector, as for \code{"POSIXct"}.
The classes correspond to the POSIX/C99 constructs of `calendar
time' (the \code{time\_t} data type) and `local time' (or
broken-down time, the \code{struct tm} data type), from which they
also inherit their names.  The components of \code{"POSIXlt"} are
integer vectors, except \code{sec}.

\code{"POSIXct"} is more convenient for including in data frames, and
\code{"POSIXlt"} is closer to human-readable forms.  A virtual class
\code{"POSIXt"} exists from which both of the classes inherit: it is
used to allow operations such as subtraction to mix the two classes.
Note that \code{\LinkA{length}{length}(x)} is the length of the corresponding
(abstract) date/time vector, also in the \code{"POSIXlt"} case.

Components \code{wday} and \code{yday} of \code{"POSIXlt"} are for
information, and are not used in the conversion to calendar time.
However, \code{isdst} is needed to distinguish times at the end of
DST: typically 1am to 2am occurs twice, first in DST and then in
standard time.  At all other times \code{isdst} can be deduced from
the first six values, but the behaviour if it is set incorrectly is
platform-dependent.



Logical comparisons and limited arithmetic are available for both
classes.  One can add or subtract a number of seconds from a date-time
object, but not add two date-time objects.  Subtraction of two
date-time objects is equivalent to using \code{\LinkA{difftime}{difftime}}.  Be
aware that \code{"POSIXlt"} objects will be interpreted as being in
the current timezone for these operations, unless a timezone has been
specified.

\code{"POSIXlt"} objects will often have an attribute \code{"tzone"},
a character vector of length 3 giving the timezone name from the
\env{TZ} environment variable and the names of the base timezone
and the alternate (daylight-saving) timezone.  Sometimes this may
just be of length one, giving the timezone name.

\code{"POSIXct"} objects may also have an attribute \code{"tzone"}, a
character vector of length one.  If set to a non-empty value, it will
determine how the object is converted to class \code{"POSIXlt"} and in
particular how it is printed.  This is usually desirable, but if you
want to specify an object in a particular timezone but to be printed
in the current timezone you may want to remove the \code{"tzone"}
attribute (e.g. by \code{c(x)}).

Unfortunately, the conversion is complicated by the operation of time
zones and leap seconds (24 days have been 86401 seconds long so far:
the times of the extra seconds are in the object \code{.leap.seconds}).
The details of this are entrusted to the OS services where possible.
This always covers the period 1970--2037, and on most machines
back to 1902 (when time zones were in their infancy).  Outside
the platform limits we use our own C code.  This uses the offset from
GMT in use either for 1902 (when there was no DST) or that predicted
for one of 2030 to 2037 (chosen so that the likely DST transition days
are Sundays), and uses the alternate (daylight-saving) timezone only
if \code{isdst} is positive or (if \code{-1}) if DST was predicted to
be in operation in the 2030s on that day.  (There is no reason to
suppose that the DST rules will remain the same in the future, and
indeed the US legislated in 2005 to change its rules as from 2007,
with a possible future reversion.)

It seems that some rare systems use leap seconds, but most ignore
them (as required by POSIX).  This is detected and corrected for at
build time, so all \code{"POSIXct"} times used by \R{} do not include
leap seconds. (Conceivably this could be wrong if the system has
changed since build time, just possibly by changing locales or the
\file{zoneinfo} database.)

Using \code{\LinkA{c}{c}} on \code{"POSIXlt"} objects converts them to the
current time zone, and on \code{"POSIXct"} objects drops any
\code{"tzone"} attributes (even if they are all marked with the same
time zone).

A few times have specific issues.  First, the leap seconds are ignored,
and real times such as \code{"2005-12-31 23:59:60"} are (probably)
treated as the next second.  However, they will never be generated by
\R{}, and are unlikely to arise as input.  Second, on some OSes there is
a problem in the POSIX/C99 standard with \code{"1969-12-31 23:59:59 UTC"},
which is \code{-1} in calendar time and that value is on those OSes
also used as an error code.  Thus \code{as.POSIXct("1969-12-31
  23:59:59", format = "\%Y-\%m-\%d \%H:\%M:\%S", tz = "UTC")} may give
\code{NA}, and hence \code{as.POSIXct("1969-12-31 23:59:59",
  tz = "UTC")} will give \code{"1969-12-31 23:59:00"}.  Other OSes
(including the code used by \R{} on Windows) report errors separately
and so are able to handle that time as valid.

The print methods respect \code{\LinkA{options}{options}("max.print")}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Section}{Sub-second Accuracy}
Classes \code{"POSIXct"} and  \code{"POSIXlt"} are able to express
fractions of a second.  (Conversion of fractions between the two forms
may not be exact, but will have better than microsecond accuracy.)

Fractional seconds are printed only if
\code{\LinkA{options}{options}("digits.secs")} is set: see \code{\LinkA{strftime}{strftime}}.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Warning}
Some Unix-like systems (especially Linux ones) do not have environment
variable \env{TZ}
set, yet have internal code that expects it (as does POSIX).  We have
tried to work around this, but if you get unexpected results try
setting \env{TZ}.  See \code{\LinkA{Sys.timezone}{Sys.timezone}} for valid settings.

\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
read.dcf(file, fields = NULL, all = FALSE, keep.white = NULL)

write.dcf(x, file = "", append = FALSE,
          indent = 0.1 * getOption("width"),

\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{file}] either a character string naming a file or a \LinkA{connection}{connection}.
\code{""} indicates output to the console.  For \code{read.dcf} this
can name a compressed file (see \code{\LinkA{gzfile}{gzfile}}).
\item[\code{fields}] Fields to read from the DCF file.  Default is to read all
fields.
\item[\code{all}] a logical indicating whether in case of multiple
occurrences of a field in a record, all these should be gathered.
If \code{all} is false (default), only the last such occurrence is
used.
\item[\code{keep.white}] a character string with the names of the fields for
which whitespace should be kept as is, or \code{NULL} (default)
indicating that there are no such fields.  Coerced to character if
possible.  For fields where whitespace is not to be kept as is,
\code{read.dcf} removes leading and trailing whitespace, and
\code{write.dcf} folds using \code{\LinkA{strwrap}{strwrap}}.

\item[\code{x}] the object to be written, typically a data frame.  If not, it
is attempted to coerce \code{x} to a data frame.
\item[\code{append}] logical.  If \code{TRUE}, the output is appended to the
file.  If \code{FALSE}, any existing file of the name is destroyed.
\item[\code{indent}] a positive integer specifying the indentation for
continuation lines in output entries.
\item[\code{width}] a positive integer giving the target column for wrapping
lines in the output.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
DCF is a simple format for storing databases in plain text files that
can easily be directly read and written by humans.  DCF is used in
various places to store \R{} system information, like descriptions and
contents of packages.

The DCF rules as implemented in \R{} are:
\begin{enumerate}

\item A database consists of one or more records, each with one or
more named fields.  Not every record must contain each field.
Fields may appear more than once in a record.
\item Regular lines start with a non-whitespace character.
\item Regular lines are of form \code{tag:value}, i.e., have a name
tag and a value for the field, separated by \code{:} (only the first
\code{:} counts).  The value can be empty (i.e., whitespace only).
\item Lines starting with whitespace are continuation lines (to the
preceding field) if at least one character in the line is
non-whitespace.  Continuation lines where the only non-whitespace
character is a \samp{.} are taken as blank lines (allowing for
multi-paragraph field values).
\item Records are separated by one or more empty (i.e., whitespace
only) lines.

\end{enumerate}


Note that \code{read.dcf(all = FALSE)} reads the file byte-by-byte.
This allows a \file{DESCRIPTION} file to be read and only its ASCII
fields used, or its \samp{Encoding} field used to re-encode the
remaining fields.

\code{write.dcf} does not write \code{NA} fields.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
The default \code{read.dcf(all = FALSE)} returns a character matrix
with one row per record and one column per field.  Leading and
trailing whitespace of field values is ignored unless a field is
listed in \code{keep.white}.  If a tag name is specified in the file,
but the corresponding value is empty, then an empty string is
returned.  If the tag name of a field is specified in \code{fields}
but never used in a record, then the corresponding value is \code{NA}.
If fields are repeated within a record, the last one encountered is
returned.  Malformed lines lead to an error.

For \code{read.dcf(all = TRUE)} a data frame is returned, again with
one row per record and one column per field.  The columns are lists of
character vectors for fields with multiple occurrences, and character
vectors otherwise.

Note that an empty \code{file} is a valid DCF file, and
\code{read.dcf} will return a zero-row matrix or data frame.

For \code{write.dcf}, invisible \code{NULL}.

by the user once the browser has been entered, and provide a mechanism to
allow users to identify which breakpoint has been activated.

\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{fun}] any interpreted \R{} function.
\item[\code{text}] a text string that can be retrieved when the browser is entered.
\item[\code{condition}] a condition that can be retrieved when the browser is entered.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
When a function flagged for debugging is entered, normal execution
is suspended and the body of function is executed one statement at a
time.  A new browser context is initiated for each step (and the
previous one destroyed).

At the debug prompt the user can enter commands or \R{} expressions,
followed by a newline.  The commands are

\begin{description}

\item[\code{n}] (or just an empty line, by default).
Advance to the next step.
\item[\code{c}] continue to the end of the current context: e.g. to the
end of the loop if within a loop or to the end of the function.
\item[\code{cont}] synonym for \code{c}.
\item[\code{where}] print a stack trace of all active function calls.
\item[\code{Q}] exit the browser and the current evaluation and
return to the top-level prompt.

\end{description}

(Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored, except for an empty line).

Anything else entered at the debug prompt is interpreted as an
\R{} expression to be evaluated in the calling environment: in
particular typing an object name will cause the object to be printed,
and \code{ls()} lists the objects in the calling frame.  (If you want
to look at an object with a name such as \code{n}, print it explicitly.)

Setting \LinkA{option}{options} \code{"browserNLdisabled"} to \code{TRUE}
disables the use of an empty line as a synonym for \code{n}.  If this
is done, the user will be re-prompted for input until a valid command
or an expression is entered.

To debug a function is defined inside a function, single-step though
to the end of its definition, and then call \code{debug} on its name.

If you want to debug a function not starting at the very beginning,
use \code{\LinkA{trace}{trace}(..., at = *)} or \code{\LinkA{setBreakpoint}{setBreakpoint}}.

Using \code{debug} is persistent, and unless debugging is turned off
the debugger will be entered on every invocation (note that if the
function is removed and replaced the debug state is not preserved).
Use \code{debugonce} to enter the debugger only the next time the
function is invoked.

In order to debug S4 methods (see \code{\LinkA{Methods}{Methods}}), you
need to use \code{\LinkA{trace}{trace}}, typically calling \code{\LinkA{browser}{browser}},
e.g., as \\{}
\code{trace("plot", browser, exit=browser, signature = c("track", "missing"))}

The number of lines printed for the deparsed call when a function is
entered for debugging can be limited by setting
\code{\LinkA{options}{options}(deparse.max.lines)}.

When debugging is enabled on a byte compiled function then the
interpreted version of the function will be used until debugging is
disabled.

\code{delayedAssign} creates a \emph{promise} to evaluate the given

of (interpreted) functions.
\end{Description}

\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] a variable name (given as a quoted string in the function call)
\item[\code{value}] an expression to be assigned to \code{x}

\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
Both \code{eval.env} and \code{assign.env} default to the currently active
environment.

The expression assigned to a promise by \code{delayedAssign} will
not be evaluated until it is eventually `forced'.  This happens when
the variable is first accessed.

When the promise is eventually forced, it is evaluated within the
environment specified by \code{eval.env} (whose contents may have changed in
the meantime).  After that, the value is fixed and the expression will
not be evaluated again.

        nlines = -1L)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{expr}] any \R{} expression.
\item[\code{width.cutoff}] integer in \eqn{[20, 500]}{} determining the cutoff
(in bytes) at which line-breaking is tried.
\item[\code{backtick}] logical indicating whether symbolic names should be
enclosed in backticks if they do not follow the standard syntax.
\item[\code{control}] character vector of deparsing options.  See
\code{\LinkA{.deparseOpts}{.deparseOpts}}.
\item[\code{nlines}] integer: the maximum number of lines to produce.
Negative values indicate no limit.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
This function turns unevaluated expressions (where `expression'
is taken in a wider sense than the strict concept of a vector of mode
\code{"expression"} used in \code{\LinkA{expression}{expression}}) into character
strings (a kind of inverse to \code{\LinkA{parse}{parse}}).

A typical use of this is to create informative labels for data sets
and plots.  The example shows a simple use of this facility.  It uses
the functions \code{deparse} and \code{substitute} to create labels
for a plot which are character string versions of the actual arguments
to the function \code{myplot}.

The default for the \code{backtick} option is not to quote single
symbols but only composite expressions.  This is a compromise to
avoid breaking existing code.

Using \code{control = "all"} comes closest to making \code{deparse()}
an inverse of \code{parse()}.  However, not all objects are
deparse-able even with this option and a warning will be issued if the
function recognizes that it is being asked to do the impossible.

Numeric and complex vectors are converted using 15 significant digits:
see \code{\LinkA{as.character}{as.character}} for more details.

\code{width.cutoff} is a lower bound for the line lengths: deparsing a
line proceeds until at least \code{width.cutoff} \emph{bytes} have
been output and e.g. \code{arg = value} expressions will not be split
across lines.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
To avoid the risk of a source attribute out of sync with the actual
function definition, the source attribute of a function will never 
be deparsed as an attribute.

Deparsing internal structures may not be accurate: for example the
graphics display list recorded by \code{\LinkA{recordPlot}{recordPlot}} is not
intended to be deparsed and \code{.Internal} calls will be shown as
primitive calls.

\begin{Details}\relax
This is called by \code{\LinkA{deparse}{deparse}}, \code{\LinkA{dput}{dput}} and
\code{\LinkA{dump}{dump}} to process their \code{control} argument.

The \code{control} argument is a vector containing zero or more of the
following strings.  Partial string matching is used.
\begin{description}

\item[\code{keepInteger}] 
Either surround integer vectors by \code{as.integer()} or use
suffix \code{L}, so they are not converted to type double when
parsed.  This includes making sure that integer \code{NA}s are
preserved (via \code{NA\_integer\_} if there are no non-\code{NA}
values in the vector, unless \code{"S\_compatible"} is set).

\item[\code{quoteExpressions}] 
Surround expressions with \code{quote()}, so they are not
evaluated when re-parsed.

\item[\code{showAttributes}] 
If the object has attributes (other than a \code{source}
attribute), use \code{structure()} to display them as well as the
object value.  This is the default for \code{\LinkA{deparse}{deparse}} and
\code{\LinkA{dput}{dput}}.

\item[\code{useSource}] 
If the object has a \code{source} attribute, display that instead
of deparsing the object.  Currently only applies to function
definitions.

\item[\code{warnIncomplete}] 
Some exotic objects such as \LinkA{environment}{environment}s,
external pointers, etc. can not be deparsed properly.  This option
causes a warning to be issued if the deparser recognizes one of these
situations.

Also, the parser in \R{} < 2.7.0 would only accept strings of up to
8192 bytes, and this option gives a warning for longer strings.

\item[\code{keepNA}] 
Integer, real and character \code{NA}s are surrounded by coercion
where necessary to ensure that they are parsed to the same type.

\item[\code{all}] 
An abbreviated way to specify all of the options
listed above.  This is the default for \code{dump}, and the options
used by \code{\LinkA{edit}{edit}} (which are fixed).

\item[\code{delayPromises}] 
Deparse promises in the form <promise: expression> rather than
evaluating them.  The value and the environment of the promise
will not be shown and the deparsed code cannot be sourced.

\item[\code{S\_compatible}] 
Make deparsing as far as possible compatible with S and \R{} < 2.5.0.
For compatibility with S, integer values of double vectors are
deparsed with a trailing decimal point.  Backticks are not used.


\end{description}

For the most readable (but perhaps incomplete) display, use
\code{control = NULL}. This displays the object's value, but not its
attributes.  The default in \code{\LinkA{deparse}{deparse}} is to display the
attributes as well, but not to use any of the other options to make
the result parseable.  (\code{\LinkA{dput}{dput}} and \code{\LinkA{dump}{dump}} do
use more default options, and printing of functions without sources
uses \code{c("keepInteger", "keepNA")}.)

Using \code{control = "all"} comes closest to making \code{deparse()}
an inverse of \code{parse()}.  However, not all objects are
deparse-able even with this option.  A warning will be issued if the
function recognizes that it is being asked to do the impossible.

\begin{Details}\relax
This is most commonly used with a single number argument referring to a
position on the search list, and can also be used with a unquoted or
quoted name of an item on the search list such as \code{package:tools}.

If a package has a namespace, detaching it does not by default unload
the namespace (and may not even with \code{unload=TRUE}), and
detaching will not in general unload any dynamically loaded compiled
code (DLLs).  Further, registered S3 methods from the namespace will
not be removed.  If you use \code{\LinkA{library}{library}} on a package whose
namespace is loaded, it attaches the exports of the already loaded
namespace.  So detaching and re-attaching a package may not refresh
some or all components of the package, and is inadvisable.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
The return value is \LinkA{invisible}{invisible}.  It is \code{NULL} when a
package is detached, otherwise the environment which was returned by
\code{\LinkA{attach}{attach}} when the object was attached (incorporating any
changes since it was attached).
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
You cannot detach either the workspace (position 1) nor the \pkg{base}
package (the last item in the search list), and attempting to do so
will throw an error.

Unloading some namespaces has undesirable side effects:
e.g. unloading \pkg{grid} closes all graphics devices, and on most
systems \pkg{tcltk} cannot be reloaded once it has been unloaded and
may crash \R{} if this is attempted.

\HeaderA{diag}{Matrix Diagonals}{diag}
\aliasA{diag<\Rdash}{diag}{diag<.Rdash.}
\keyword{array}{diag}
%
\begin{Description}\relax
Extract or replace the diagonal of a matrix,
or construct a diagonal matrix.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
diag(x = 1, nrow, ncol)
diag(x) <- value
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] a matrix, vector or 1D array, or missing.
\item[\code{nrow, ncol}] Optional dimensions for the result when \code{x} is
not a matrix.
\item[\code{value}] either a single value or a vector of length equal to that
of the current diagonal.  Should be of a mode which can be coerced
to that of \code{x}.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{diag} has four distinct usages:
\begin{enumerate}

\item \code{x} is a matrix, when it extracts the diagonal.
\item \code{x} is missing and \code{nrow} is specified, it returns
an identity matrix.
\item \code{x} is a scalar (length-one vector) and the only
argument, it returns a square identity matrix of size given by the scalar.
\item \code{x} is a numeric vector, either of length at least 2 or there
were further arguments.  This returns a matrix with the given
diagonal and zero off-diagonal entries.

\end{enumerate}

It is an error to specify \code{nrow} or \code{ncol} in the first case.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
If \code{x} is a matrix then \code{diag(x)} returns the diagonal of
\code{x}.  The resulting vector will have \code{\LinkA{names}{names}} if the
matrix \code{x} has matching column and rownames.

The replacement form sets the diagonal of the matrix \code{x} to the
given value(s).

In all other cases the value is a diagonal matrix with \code{nrow}
rows and \code{ncol} columns (if \code{ncol} is not given the matrix
is square).  Here \code{nrow} is taken from the argument if specified,
otherwise inferred from \code{x}: if that is a vector (or 1D array) of
length two or more, then its length is the number of rows, but if it
is of length one and neither \code{nrow} nor \code{ncol} is specified,
\code{nrow = as.integer(x)}.

When a diagonal matrix is returned, the diagonal elements are one
except in the fourth case, when \code{x} gives the diagonal elements:
it will be recycled or truncated as needed, but fractional recycling
and truncation will give a warning.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
Using \code{diag(x)} can have unexpected effects if \code{x} is a
vector that could be of length one.  Use \code{diag(x, nrow =
    length(x))} for consistent behaviour.

\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
Function \code{difftime} calculates a difference of two date/time
objects and returns an object of class \code{"difftime"} with an
attribute indicating the units.  The
\code{\LinkA{Math}{S3groupGeneric}} group method provides
\code{\LinkA{round}{round}}, \code{\LinkA{signif}{signif}}, \code{\LinkA{floor}{floor}},
\code{\LinkA{ceiling}{ceiling}}, \code{\LinkA{trunc}{trunc}}, \code{\LinkA{abs}{abs}}, and
\code{\LinkA{sign}{sign}} methods for objects of this class, and there are
methods for the group-generic (see
\code{\LinkA{Ops}{S3groupGeneric}}) logical and arithmetic
operations.

If \code{units = "auto"}, a suitable set of units is chosen, the largest
possible (excluding \code{"weeks"}) in which all the absolute
differences are greater than one.

Subtraction of date-time objects gives an object of this class,
by calling \code{difftime} with \code{units = "auto"}.  Alternatively,
\code{as.difftime()} works on character-coded or numeric time
intervals; in the latter case, units must be specified, and
\code{format} has no effect.

Limited arithmetic is available on \code{"difftime"} objects: they can
be added or subtracted, and multiplied or divided by a numeric vector.
In addition, adding or subtracting a numeric vector by a
\code{"difftime"} object implicitly converts the numeric vector to a
\code{"difftime"} object with the same units as the \code{"difftime"}
object.  There are methods for \code{\LinkA{mean}{mean}} and
\code{\LinkA{sum}{sum}} (via the \code{\LinkA{Summary}{S3groupGeneric}}
group generic).

The units of a \code{"difftime"} object can be extracted by the
\code{units} function, which also has a replacement form.  If the
units are changed, the numerical value is scaled accordingly.  As from
\R{} 2.15.0 the replacement version keeps attributes such as names and
dimensions.

The \code{as.double} method returns the numeric value expressed in
the specified units.  Using  \code{units = "auto"} means the units of the
object.

The \code{format} method simply formats the numeric value and appends
the units as a text string.

The default behaviour when \code{time1} or \code{time2} was a
\code{"POSIXlt"} object changed in \R{} 2.12.0: previously such objects
were regarded as in the timezone given by \code{tz} which defaulted to
the current timezone.

\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The functions \code{dimnames} and \code{dimnames<-} are generic.

For an \code{\LinkA{array}{array}} (and hence in particular, for a
\code{\LinkA{matrix}{matrix}}), they retrieve or set the \code{dimnames}
attribute (see \LinkA{attributes}{attributes}) of the object.  A list
\code{value} can have names, and these will be used to label the
dimensions of the array where appropriate.

The replacement method for arrays/matrices coerces vector and factor
elements of \code{value} to character, but does not dispatch methods
for \code{as.character}.  It coerces zero-length elements to
\code{NULL}, and a zero-length list to \code{NULL}.  If \code{value}
is a list shorter than the number of dimensions, it is extended with
\code{NULL}s to the needed length.

Both have methods for data frames.  The dimnames of a data frame are
its \code{\LinkA{row.names}{row.names}} and its \code{\LinkA{names}{names}}.  For the
replacement method each component of \code{value} will be coerced by
\code{\LinkA{as.character}{as.character}}.

For a 1D matrix the \code{\LinkA{names}{names}} are the same thing as the
(only) component of the \code{dimnames}.

Both are \LinkA{primitive}{primitive} functions.  
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
The dimnames of a matrix or array can be \code{NULL} (which is not
stored) or a list of the same length as \code{dim(x)}.  If a list, its
components are either \code{NULL} or a character vector with positive
length of the appropriate dimension of \code{x}.  The list can have
names.  It is possible that all components are \code{NULL}: such
dimnames may get converted to \code{NULL}.

For the \code{"data.frame"} method both dimnames are character
vectors, and the rownames must contain no duplicates nor missing values.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
Setting components of the dimnames, e.g.
\code{dimnames(A)[[1]] <- value} is a common paradigm, but note that
it will not work if the value assigned is \code{NULL}.  Use
\code{\LinkA{rownames}{rownames}} instead, or (as it does) manipulate the whole
dimnames list.

\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{length}] A non-negative integer specifying the desired length.
Double values will be coerced to integer:
supplying an argument of length other than one is an error.

\begin{Details}\relax
\code{double} creates a double-precision vector of the specified
length.  The elements of the vector are all equal to \code{0}.
It is identical to \code{\LinkA{numeric}{numeric}} (and \code{real}).

\code{as.double} is a generic function.  It is identical to
\code{as.numeric} (and \code{as.real}).  Methods should return an
object of base type \code{"double"}.

\code{is.double} is a test of double \LinkA{type}{type}.

\emph{\R{} has no single precision data type.  All real numbers are
stored in double precision format}.  The functions \code{as.single}
and \code{single} are identical to \code{as.double} and \code{double}
except they set the attribute \code{Csingle} that is used in the
\code{\LinkA{.C}{.C}} and \code{\LinkA{.Fortran}{.Fortran}} interface, and they are
intended only to be used in that context.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{double} creates a double-precision vector of the specified
length.  The elements of the vector are all equal to \code{0}.

\code{as.double} attempts to coerce its argument to be of double type:
like \code{\LinkA{as.vector}{as.vector}} it strips attributes including names.
(To ensure that an object is of double type without stripping
attributes, use \code{\LinkA{storage.mode}{storage.mode}}.)  Character strings
containing optional whitespace followed by either a decimal
representation or a hexadecimal representation (starting with
\code{0x} or \code{0X}) can be converted, as can special values such
as \code{"NA"}, \code{"NaN"}, \code{"Inf"} and \code{"infinity"},
irrespective of case.

\code{as.double} for factors yields the codes underlying the factor
levels, not the numeric representation of the labels, see also
\code{\LinkA{factor}{factor}}.

\code{is.double} returns \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} depending on
whether its argument is of double \LinkA{type}{type} or not.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{Double-precision values}
All \R{} platforms are required to work with values conforming to the
IEC 60559 (also known as IEEE 754) standard.  This basically works
with a precision of 53 bits, and represents to that precision a range
of absolute values from about \eqn{2 \times 10^{-308}}{} to
\eqn{2 \times 10^{308}}{}.  It also has special values
\code{\LinkA{NaN}{NaN}} (many of them), plus and minus infinity and plus and
minus zero (although \R{} acts as if these are the same).  There are
also \emph{denormal(ized)} (or \emph{subnormal}) numbers with absolute
values above or below the range given above but represented to less
precision.

See \code{\LinkA{.Machine}{.Machine}} for precise information on these limits.
Note that ultimately how double precision numbers are handled is down
to the CPU/FPU and compiler.

In IEEE 754-2008/IEC60559:2011 this is called `binary64' format.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Note on names}
It is a historical anomaly that \R{} has three names for its
floating-point vectors, \code{\LinkA{double}{double}}, \code{\LinkA{numeric}{numeric}}
and \code{\LinkA{real}{real}}.

\code{double} is the name of the \LinkA{type}{type}.
\code{numeric} is the name of the \LinkA{mode}{mode} and also of the implicit
\LinkA{class}{class}.  As an S4 formal class, use \code{"numeric"}.

\code{real} is deprecated and should not be used in new code.

The potential confusion is that \R{} has used \emph{\LinkA{mode}{mode}}
\code{"numeric"} to mean `double or integer', which conflicts
with the S4 usage.  Thus \code{is.numeric} tests the mode, not the
class, but \code{as.numeric} (which is identical to \code{as.double})
coerces to the class.

\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] an object.
\item[\code{file}] either a character string naming a file or a
\LinkA{connection}{connection}. \code{""} indicates output to the console.
\item[\code{control}] character vector indicating deparsing options.
See \code{\LinkA{.deparseOpts}{.deparseOpts}} for their description.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{dput} opens \code{file} and deparses the object \code{x} into
that file.  The object name is not written (unlike \code{dump}).
If \code{x} is a function the associated environment is stripped.
Hence scoping information can be lost.

Deparsing an object is difficult, and not always possible.  With the
default \code{control}, \code{dput()} attempts to deparse in a way
that is readable, but for more complex or unusual objects (see
\code{\LinkA{dump}{dump}}, not likely
to be parsed as identical to the original.  Use \code{control = "all"}
for the most complete deparsing; use \code{control = NULL} for the
simplest deparsing, not even including attributes.

\code{dput} will warn if fewer characters were written to a file than
expected, which may indicate a full or corrupt file system.

To display saved source rather than deparsing the internal representation 
include \code{"useSource"} in \code{control}.  \R{} currently saves
source only for function definitions.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
For \code{dput}, the first argument invisibly.

For \code{dget}, the object created.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
To avoid the risk of a source attribute out of sync with the actual
function definition, the source attribute of a function will never 
be written as an attribute.

If \code{x} is an object with a \code{dim} attribute (e.g., a matrix

\code{x}, but with any extents of length one removed.  Any
accompanying \code{dimnames} attribute is adjusted and returned with
\code{x}: if the result is a vector the \code{names} are taken from
the \code{dimnames} (if any).  If the result is a length-one vector,
the names are taken from the first dimension with a dimname.

Array subsetting (\code{\LinkA{[}{[}}) performs this reduction unless used

This function takes a vector of names of \R{} objects and produces
text representations of the objects on a file or connection.
A \code{dump} file can usually be \code{\LinkA{source}{source}}d into another
\R{} (or S) session.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
dump(list, file = "dumpdata.R", append = FALSE, 
     control = "all", envir = parent.frame(), evaluate = TRUE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{list}] character.  The names of one or more \R{} objects to be dumped.

\item[\code{file}] either a character string naming a file or a
\LinkA{connection}{connection}.  \code{""} indicates output to the console.

\item[\code{append}] if \code{TRUE} and \code{file} is a character string,
output will be appended to \code{file}; otherwise, it will overwrite
the contents of \code{file}.

\item[\code{control}] character vector indicating deparsing options.
See \code{\LinkA{.deparseOpts}{.deparseOpts}} for their description.

\item[\code{envir}] the environment to search for objects.

\item[\code{evaluate}] logical.  Should promises be evaluated?
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
If some of the objects named do not exist (in scope), they are
omitted, with a warning.  If \code{file} is a file and no objects
exist then no file is created.

\code{source}ing may not produce an identical copy of
\code{dump}ed objects.  A warning is issued if it is likely that
problems will arise, for example when dumping exotic or complex
objects (see the Note).

\code{dump} will also warn if fewer characters were written to a file
than expected, which may indicate a full or corrupt file system.

A \code{dump} file can be \code{\LinkA{source}{source}}d into another \R{} (or
perhaps S) session, but the function \code{\LinkA{save}{save}} is designed to
be used for transporting \R{} data, and will work with \R{} objects that
\code{dump} does not handle.

To produce a more readable representation of an object, use
\code{control = NULL}.  This will skip attributes, and will make other
simplifications that make \code{source} less likely to produce an
identical copy.  See \code{\LinkA{deparse}{deparse}} for details.

To deparse the internal representation of a function rather than
displaying the saved source, use \code{control = c("keepInteger",
    "warnIncomplete", "keepNA")}.  This will lose all formatting and
comments, but may be useful in those cases where the saved source is
no longer correct.

Promises will normally only be encountered by users as a result of
lazy-loading (when the default \code{evaluate = TRUE} is essential)
and after the use of \code{\LinkA{delayedAssign}{delayedAssign}},
when \code{evaluate = FALSE} might be intended.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
An invisible character vector containing the names of the objects
which were dumped.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
As \code{dump} is defined in the base namespace, the \pkg{base}
package will be searched \emph{before} the global environment unless
\code{dump} is called from the top level prompt or the \code{envir}
argument is given explicitly.

To avoid the risk of a source attribute becoming out of sync with the
actual function definition, the source attribute of a function will
never be dumped as an attribute.

Currently environments, external pointers, weak references and objects
of type \code{S4} are not deparsed in a way that can be
\code{source}d.  In addition, language objects are deparsed in a
simple way whatever the value of \code{control}, and this includes not
dumping their attributes (which will result in a warning).

%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] a vector or a data frame or an array or \code{NULL}.
\item[\code{incomparables}] a vector of values that cannot be compared.
\code{FALSE} is a special value, meaning that all values can be
compared, and may be the only value accepted for methods other than
the default.  It will be coerced internally to the same type as
\code{x}.
\item[\code{fromLast}] logical indicating if duplication should be considered
from the reverse side, i.e., the last (or rightmost) of identical
elements would correspond to \code{duplicated=FALSE}.
\item[\code{...}] arguments for particular methods.
\item[\code{MARGIN}] the array margin to be held fixed: see
\code{\LinkA{apply}{apply}}, and note that \code{MARGIN = 0} maybe useful.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
These are generic functions with methods for vectors (including
lists), data frames and arrays (including matrices).

For the default methods, and whenever there are equivalent method
definitions for \code{duplicated} and \code{anyDuplicated},
\code{anyDuplicated(x,...)} is a ``generalized'' shortcut for
\code{any(duplicated(x,...))}, in the sense that it returns the
\emph{index} \code{i} of the first duplicated entry \code{x[i]} if
there is one, and \code{0} otherwise.  Their behaviours may be
different when at least one of \code{duplicated} and
\code{anyDuplicated} has a relevant method.

\code{duplicated(x, fromLast=TRUE)} is equivalent to but faster than
\code{rev(duplicated(rev(x)))}.

The data frame method works by pasting together a character
representation of the rows separated by \code{\bsl{}r}, so may be imperfect
if the data frame has characters with embedded carriage returns or
columns which do not reliably map to characters.

The array method calculates for each element of the sub-array
specified by \code{MARGIN} if the remaining dimensions are identical
to those for an earlier (or later, when \code{fromLast=TRUE}) element
(in row-major order).  This would most commonly be used to find
duplicated rows (the default) or columns (with \code{MARGIN = 2}).
Note that \code{MARGIN = 0} returns an array of the same
dimensionality attributes as \code{x}.

Missing values are regarded as equal, but \code{NaN} is not equal to
\code{NA\_real\_}.

Values in \code{incomparables} will never be marked as duplicated.
This is intended to be used for a fairly small set of values and will
not be efficient for a very large set.

When used on a data frame with more than one column, or an array or
matrix when comparing dimensions of length greater than one, this
tests for identity of character representations.  This will
catch people who unwisely rely on exact equality of floating-point
numbers!

Character strings will be compared as byte sequences if any input is
marked as \code{"bytes"}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{duplicated()}:
For a vector input, a logical vector of the same length as
\code{x}.  For a data frame, a logical vector with one element for
each row.  For a matrix or array, and when \code{MARGIN = 0}, a
logical array with the same dimensions and dimnames.

\code{anyDuplicated()}: a non-negative integer (of length one).
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{Warning}
Using this for lists is potentially slow, especially if the elements
are not atomic vectors (see \code{\LinkA{vector}{vector}}) or differ only
in their attributes.  In the worst case it is \eqn{O(n^2)}{}.

The objects \code{dyn.load} loads are called `dynamically
loadable libraries' (abbreviated to `DLL') on all platforms
except Mac OS X, which unfortunately uses the term for a different
sort of sobject.  On Unix-alikes they are also called `dynamic
shared objects' (`DSO'), or `shared objects' for
short.  (The POSIX standards use `executable object file', but
no one else does.)

See `See Also' and the `Writing R Extensions' and
`R Installation and Administration' manuals for how to create
and install a suitable DLL.

Unfortunately a very few platforms (e.g. Compaq Tru64) do not handle
the \code{PACKAGE} argument correctly, and may incorrectly find
symbols linked into \R{}.

The additional arguments to \code{dyn.load} mirror the different
aspects of the mode argument to the \code{dlopen()} routine on POSIX
systems.  They are available so that users can exercise greater control
over the loading process for an individual library.  In general, the
default values are appropriate and you should override them only if
there is good reason and you understand the implications.


External code must not change the floating point control word, but
many DLLs do so.  Common changes are to set it to use 53 bit
precision instead of R's default 64 bit precision, or to unmask
some exceptions.  \code{dyn.load} detects such changes,
and restores R's control word to its default value of hex 8001F.
This may cause the DLL to malfunction; if so, it should be rewritten
to save and restore the control word itself.  If \code{warn.FPU}
is set to \code{TRUE} using the \code{\LinkA{options}{options}} function,
a warning will be printed.  (If the warning says
that the control word was changed from some other value than 8001F,
please report the circumstances to the Windows maintainers:
that probably indicates an internal bug.)
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
The function \code{dyn.load} is used for its side effect which links
the specified DLL to the executing \R{} image.  Calls to \code{.C},
\code{.Call}, \code{.Fortran} and \code{.External} can then be used to
execute compiled C functions or Fortran subroutines contained in the
library.  The return value of \code{dyn.load} is an object of class
\code{DLLInfo}.  See \code{\LinkA{getLoadedDLLs}{getLoadedDLLs}} for information about
this class.

The function \code{dyn.unload} unlinks the DLL.  Note that unloading a
DLL and then re-loading a DLL of the same name may or may not work: on
Solaris it uses the first version loaded.

\code{is.loaded} checks if the symbol name is loaded and hence
available for use in \code{.C} or \code{.Fortran} or \code{.Call} or
\code{.External}.  It will succeed if any one of the four calling
functions would succeed in using the entry point unless \code{type} is
specified.  (See \code{\LinkA{.Fortran}{.Fortran}} for how Fortran symbols are
mapped.)
\end{Value}

\begin{Section}{Windows}
The `standard mechanisms for loading DLLs' include a
search order for where a DLL is found (if not given as an absolute
path, which is preferred), \emph{and} of where its dependent DLLs will
be found.  This search path depends on the version of Windows and its
security settings, but for versions since Windows XP SP1 it is
\begin{itemize}

\item The directory from which the application was launched.
\item The various system directories,
e.g. \file{c:/Windows/system32}, \file{c:/Windows/system} and
\file{c:/Windows}.
\item The current directory.
\item Along the search path for executables given by the environment
variable \env{PATH}.

\end{itemize}


Packages often want to supply dependent DLLs in their \file{libs}
directory, and do this by setting the \env{PATH} variable
(\code{\LinkA{library.dynam}{library.dynam}} does that automatically in recent
versions of \R{}), but the DLL search order means that DLLs in the
launch directory and in system directories will be preferred.  On
Windows XP SP1 and later there is a way to modify the search order.
If argument \code{DLLpath} is supplied to \code{dyn.load}, the latter
makes use of the Windows system call \code{SetDllDirectory} to insert
the value of \code{DLLpath} in second place, and removes the current
directory, for the duration of that \code{dyn.load} call.  (Note that
only one directory can be inserted in this way.)  On Windows 2000, the
second item in the search order is the current directory, and the
current directory is changed temporarily to implement \code{DLLpath}.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Warning}
Do not use \code{dyn.unload} on a DLL loaded by
\code{\LinkA{library.dynam}{library.dynam}}: use \code{\LinkA{library.dynam.unload}{library.dynam.unload}}.
This is needed for system housekeeping.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
\code{is.loaded} requires the name you would give to \code{.C} etc
and \strong{not} (as in S) that remapped by the defunct functions
\code{symbol.C} or \code{symbol.For}.

The creation of DLLs and the runtime linking of them into executing
programs is very platform dependent.  In recent years there has been
some simplification in the process because the C subroutine call
\code{dlopen} has become the POSIX standard for doing this.  Under
Unix-alikes \code{dyn.load} uses the \code{dlopen} mechanism and
should work on all platforms which support it.  On Windows it uses the
standard mechanism (\code{LoadLibrary}) for loading DLLs.

The original code for loading DLLs in Unix-alikes was provided by
Heiner Schwarte.

\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
eigen(x, symmetric, only.values = FALSE, EISPACK = FALSE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] a matrix whose spectral decomposition is to be computed.
\item[\code{symmetric}] if \code{TRUE}, the matrix is assumed to be symmetric
(or Hermitian if complex) and only its lower triangle (diagonal
included) is used.  If \code{symmetric} is not specified, the matrix
is inspected for symmetry.
\item[\code{only.values}] if \code{TRUE}, only the eigenvalues are computed
and returned, otherwise both eigenvalues and eigenvectors are
returned.
\item[\code{EISPACK}] logical.  Should EISPACK be used (for compatibility with
\R{} < 1.7.0)?
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
If \code{symmetric} is unspecified, the code attempts to
determine if the matrix is symmetric up to plausible numerical
inaccuracies.  It is faster and surer to set the value yourself.

\code{eigen} is preferred to \code{eigen(EISPACK = TRUE)}
for new projects, but its eigenvectors may differ in sign and
(in the asymmetric case) in normalization.  (They may also differ
between methods and between platforms.)

Computing the eigenvectors is the slow part for large matrices.

Computing the eigendecomposition of a matrix is subject to errors on a
real-world computer: the definitive analysis is Wilkinson (1965).  All
you can hope for is a solution to a problem suitably close to
\code{x}.  So even though a real asymmetric \code{x} may have an
algebraic solution with repeated real eigenvalues, the computed
solution may be of a similar matrix with complex conjugate pairs of
eigenvalues.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
The spectral decomposition of \code{x} is returned as components of a
list with components

\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{values}] a vector containing the \eqn{p}{} eigenvalues of \code{x},
sorted in \emph{decreasing} order, according to \code{Mod(values)}
in the asymmetric case when they might be complex (even for real
matrices).  For real asymmetric matrices the vector will be
complex only if complex conjugate pairs of eigenvalues are detected.

\item[\code{vectors}] either a \eqn{p\times p}{} matrix whose columns
contain the eigenvectors of \code{x}, or \code{NULL} if
\code{only.values} is \code{TRUE}.

For \code{eigen(, symmetric = FALSE, EISPACK =TRUE)} the choice of
length of the eigenvectors is not defined by EISPACK.  In all other
cases the vectors are normalized to unit length.

Recall that the eigenvectors are only defined up to a constant: even
when the length is specified they are still only defined up to a
scalar of modulus one (the sign for real matrices).


\end{ldescription}
If \code{r <- eigen(A)}, and \code{V <- r\$vectors; lam <- r\$values},
then \deqn{A = V \Lambda V^{-1}}{} (up to numerical
fuzz), where \eqn{\Lambda =}{}\code{diag(lam)}.
\end{Value}

\code{EISPACK = TRUE} (for compatibility with \R{} < 1.7.0) was formally
deprecated in \R{} 2.15.2.

\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] A character vector, or an object that can be coerced to one
by \code{\LinkA{as.character}{as.character}}.

\item[\code{justify}] character: partial matches are allowed.  If padding to
the minimum field width is needed, how should spaces be inserted?
\code{justify == "none"} is equivalent to \code{width = 0}, for
consistency with \code{format.default}.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
This escapes backslash and the control characters \samp{\bsl{}a} (bell),
\samp{\bsl{}b} (backspace), \samp{\bsl{}f} (formfeed), \samp{\bsl{}n} (line feed),
\samp{\bsl{}r} (carriage return), \samp{\bsl{}t} (tab) and \samp{\bsl{}v}
(vertical tab) as well as any non-printable characters in a
single-byte locale, which are printed in octal notation (\samp{\bsl{}xyz}
with leading zeroes).

Which characters are non-printable depends on the current locale.
Windows' reporting of printable characters is unreliable, so there all
other control characters are regarded as non-printable, and all
characters with codes 32--255 as printable in a single-byte locale.
See \code{\LinkA{print.default}{print.default}} for how non-printable characters are
handled in multi-byte locales.

If \code{quote} is a single or double quote any embedded quote of the
same type is escaped.  Note that justification is of the quoted
string, hence spaces are added outside the quotes.

\begin{Details}\relax
Character strings in \R{} can be declared to be in \code{"latin1"} or
\code{"UTF-8"} or \code{"bytes"}.  These declarations can be read by
\code{Encoding}, which will return a character vector of values
\code{"latin1"}, \code{"UTF-8"} \code{"bytes"} or \code{"unknown"}, or
set, when \code{value} is recycled as needed and other values are
silently treated as \code{"unknown"}.  ASCII strings will never be
marked with a declared encoding, since their representation is the
same in all supported encodings.  Strings marked as \code{"bytes"} are
intended to be non-ASCII strings which should be manipulated as bytes,
and never converted to a character encoding.

\code{enc2native} and \code{enc2utf8} convert elements of character
vectors to the native encoding or UTF-8 respectively, taking any
marked encoding into account.  They are \LinkA{primitive}{primitive} functions,
designed to do minimal copying.

There are other ways for character strings to acquire a declared
encoding apart from explicitly setting it (and these have changed as
\R{} has evolved).  Functions \code{\LinkA{scan}{scan}},
\code{\LinkA{read.table}{read.table}}, \code{\LinkA{readLines}{readLines}}, and
\code{\LinkA{parse}{parse}} have an \code{encoding} argument that is used to
declare encodings, \code{\LinkA{iconv}{iconv}} declares encodings from its
\code{from} argument, and console input in suitable locales is also
declared.  \code{\LinkA{intToUtf8}{intToUtf8}} declares its output as
\code{"UTF-8"}, and output text connections (see
\code{\LinkA{textConnection}{textConnection}}) are marked if running in a
suitable locale.  Under some circumstances (see its help page)
\code{\LinkA{source}{source}(encoding=)} will mark encodings of character
strings it outputs.

Most character manipulation functions will set the encoding on output
strings if it was declared on the corresponding input.  These include
\code{\LinkA{chartr}{chartr}}, \code{\LinkA{strsplit}{strsplit}(useBytes = FALSE)},
\code{\LinkA{tolower}{tolower}} and \code{\LinkA{toupper}{toupper}} as well as
\code{\LinkA{sub}{sub}(useBytes = FALSE)} and \code{\LinkA{gsub}{gsub}(useBytes =
  FALSE)}.  Note that such functions do not \emph{preserve} the
encoding, but if they know the input encoding and that the string has
been successfully re-encoded (to the current encoding or UTF-8), they
mark the output.

\code{\LinkA{substr}{substr}} does preserve the encoding, and
\code{\LinkA{chartr}{chartr}}, \code{\LinkA{tolower}{tolower}} and \code{\LinkA{toupper}{toupper}}
preserve UTF-8 encoding on systems with Unicode wide characters.  With
their \code{fixed} and \code{perl} options, \code{\LinkA{strsplit}{strsplit}},
\code{\LinkA{sub}{sub}} and \code{gsub} will give a marked UTF-8 result if
any of the inputs are UTF-8.

\code{\LinkA{paste}{paste}} and \code{\LinkA{sprintf}{sprintf}} return elements marked
as bytes if any of the corresponding inputs is marked as bytes, and 
otherwise marked as UTF-8 of any of the inputs is marked as UTF-8.

\code{\LinkA{match}{match}}, \code{\LinkA{pmatch}{pmatch}}, \code{\LinkA{charmatch}{charmatch}},
\code{\LinkA{duplicated}{duplicated}} and \code{\LinkA{unique}{unique}} all match in UTF-8

\begin{Details}\relax
Environments consist of a \emph{frame}, or collection of named
objects, and a pointer to an \emph{enclosing environment}.  The most
common example is the frame of variables local to a function call; its
\emph{enclosure} is the environment where the function was defined
(unless changed subsequently).  The enclosing environment is
distinguished from the \emph{parent frame}: the latter (returned by
\code{\LinkA{parent.frame}{parent.frame}}) refers to the environment of the caller of
a function.  Since confusion is so easy, it is best never to use
`parent' in connection with an environment (despite the
presence of the function \code{parent.env}).

When \code{\LinkA{get}{get}} or \code{\LinkA{exists}{exists}} search an environment
with the default \code{inherits = TRUE}, they look for the variable
in the frame, then in the enclosing frame, and so on.

The global environment \code{.GlobalEnv}, more often known as the
user's workspace, is the first item on the search path.  It can also
be accessed by \code{globalenv()}.  On the search path, each item's
enclosure is the next item.

The object \code{.BaseNamespaceEnv} is the namespace environment for
the base package.  The environment of the base package itself is
available as \code{baseenv()}.

If one follows the chain of enclosures found by repeatedly calling
\code{parent.env} from any environment, eventually one reaches the
empty environment \code{emptyenv()}, into which nothing may
be assigned.

The replacement function \code{parent.env<-} is extremely dangerous as
it can be used to destructively change environments in ways that

in the near future.

The replacement form of \code{environment}, \code{is.environment},
\code{baseenv}, \code{emptyenv} and \code{globalenv} are
\LinkA{primitive}{primitive} functions.

System environments, such as the base, global and empty environments,
have names as do the package and namespace environments and those
generated by \code{attach()}.  Other environments can be named by
giving a \code{"name"} attribute, but this needs to be done with care
as environments have unusual copying semantics.

\begin{Value}
If \code{fun} is a function or a formula then \code{environment(fun)}
returns the environment associated with that function or formula.
If \code{fun} is \code{NULL} then the current evaluation environment is
returned.

The replacement form sets the environment of the function or formula
\code{fun} to the \code{value} given.

\code{is.environment(obj)} returns \code{TRUE} if and only if
\code{obj} is an \code{environment}.

\code{new.env} returns a new (empty) environment with (by default)
enclosure the parent frame.

\code{parent.env} returns the enclosing environment of its argument.

\code{parent.env<-} sets the enclosing environment of its first
argument.

\code{environmentName} returns a character string, that given when
the environment is printed or \code{""} if it is not a named environment.

\code{env.profile} returns a list with the following components:
\code{size} the number of chains that can be stored in the hash table,
\code{nchains} the number of non-empty chains in the table (as
reported by \code{HASHPRI}), and \code{counts} an integer vector
giving the length of each chain (zero for empty chains).  This
function is intended to assess the performance of hashed environments.
When \code{env} is a non-hashed environment, \code{NULL} is returned.

Details of some of the environment variables which affect an \R{} session.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
It is impossible to list all the environment variables which can
affect an \R{} session: some affect the OS system functions which \R{}
uses, and others will affect add-on packages.  But here are notes on
some of the more important ones.  Those that set the defaults for
options are consulted only at startup (as are some of the others).
\begin{description}

\item[\env{HOME}:] The user's `home' directory.
\item[\env{LANGUAGE}:] Optional.  The language(s) to be used for
message translations.  This is consulted when needed.
\item[\env{LC\_ALL}:] (etc) Optional.  Use to set various aspects of
the locale -- see \code{\LinkA{Sys.getlocale}{Sys.getlocale}}.  Consulted at startup.
\item[\env{MAKEINDEX}:] The path to \command{makeindex}.
If unset to a value determined when \R{} was built.
Used by the emulation mode of \code{\LinkA{texi2dvi}{texi2dvi}} and
\code{\LinkA{texi2pdf}{texi2pdf}}.
\item[\env{R\_BATCH}:] Optional -- set in a batch session, that is
one started by \command{R CMD \LinkA{BATCH}{BATCH}}.  Most often set to
\code{""}, so test by something like
\code{!is.na(\LinkA{Sys.getenv}{Sys.getenv}("R\_BATCH", NA))}.
\item[\env{R\_BROWSER}:] The path to the default browser.  Used to
set the default value of \code{\LinkA{options}{options}("browser")}.
\item[\env{R\_COMPLETION}:] Optional.  If set to \code{FALSE},
command-line completion is not used.  (Not used by Mac OS GUI.)
\item[\env{R\_DEFAULT\_PACKAGES}:] A comma-separated list of packages
which are to be attached in every session.  See \code{\LinkA{options}{options}}.
\item[\env{R\_DOC\_DIR}:] The location of the \R{} \file{doc}
directory.  Set by \R{}.
\item[\env{R\_ENVIRON}:] Optional.  The path to the site environment
file: see \LinkA{Startup}{Startup}.  Consulted at startup.
\item[\env{R\_GSCMD}:] Optional.  The path to Ghostscript, used by
\code{\LinkA{dev2bitmap}{dev2bitmap}}, \code{\LinkA{bitmap}{bitmap}} and
\code{\LinkA{embedFonts}{embedFonts}}.  Consulted when those functions are
invoked.  Since it will be treated as if passed to
\code{\LinkA{system}{system}}, spaces and shell metacharacters should be escaped.
\item[\env{R\_HISTFILE}:] Optional.  The path of the history file:
see \LinkA{Startup}{Startup}.  Consulted at startup and when the history is
saved.
\item[\env{R\_HISTSIZE}:] Optional.  The maximum size of the history
file, in lines.  Exactly how this is used depends on the
interface.
For \command{Rgui} it controls the number of lines saved to the
history file: the size of the history used in the session is
controlled by the console customization: see \code{\LinkA{Rconsole}{Rconsole}}.

\item[\env{R\_HOME}:] The top-level directory of the \R{}
installation: see \code{\LinkA{R.home}{R.home}}.  Set by \R{}.
\item[\env{R\_INCLUDE\_DIR}:] The location of the \R{} \file{include}
directory.  Set by \R{}.
\item[\env{R\_LIBS}:] Optional.  Used for initial setting of
\code{\LinkA{.libPaths}{.libPaths}}.
\item[\env{R\_LIBS\_SITE}:] Optional.  Used for initial setting of
\code{\LinkA{.libPaths}{.libPaths}}.
\item[\env{R\_LIBS\_USER}:] Optional.  Used for initial setting of
\code{\LinkA{.libPaths}{.libPaths}}.
\item[\env{R\_PAPERSIZE}:] Optional.  Used to set the default for
\code{\LinkA{options}{options}("papersize")}, e.g. used by
\code{\LinkA{pdf}{pdf}} and \code{\LinkA{postscript}{postscript}}.
\item[\env{R\_PDFVIEWER}:] The path to the default PDF viewer.  Used
by \command{R CMD Rd2pdf}.
\item[\env{R\_PLATFORM}:] The platform -- a string of the form
\code{\var{cpu}-\var{vendor}-\var{os}}, see \code{\LinkA{R.Version}{R.Version}}.
\item[\env{R\_PROFILE}:] Optional.  The path to the site profile
file: see \LinkA{Startup}{Startup}.  Consulted at startup.
\item[\env{R\_RD4PDF}:] Options for \command{pdflatex} processing of
\code{Rd} files.  Used by \command{R CMD Rd2pdf}.
\item[\env{R\_SHARE\_DIR}:] The location of the \R{} \file{share}
directory.  Set by \R{}.
\item[\env{R\_TEXI2DVICMD}:] The path to \command{texi2dvi}.
Defaults to the value of \env{TEXI2DVI}, and if that is unset to a
value determined when \R{} was built.

\item[\env{R\_UNZIPCMD}:] The path to \command{unzip}.  Sets the
initial value for \code{\LinkA{options}{options}("unzip")} on a Unix-alike
when namespace \pkg{utils} is loaded.
\item[\env{R\_ZIPCMD}:] The path to \command{zip}. Used by
\code{\LinkA{zip}{zip}} and by \command{R CMD INSTALL --build} on Windows.
\item[\env{TMPDIR}, \env{TMP}, \env{TEMP}:] Consulted (in that
order) when setting the temporary directory for the session: see
\code{\LinkA{tempdir}{tempdir}}.  \env{TMPDIR} is also used by some of the
utilities see the help for \code{\LinkA{build}{build}}.
\item[\env{TZ}:] Optional.  The current timezone.  See
\code{\LinkA{Sys.timezone}{Sys.timezone}} for the system-specific
formats.  Consulted as needed.
\item[\env{no\_proxy}, \env{http\_proxy}, \env{ftp\_proxy}:] 
(and more).  Optional.  Settings for \code{\LinkA{download.file}{download.file}}:
see its help for further details.

\item[\env{GSC}:] Optional: the path to Ghostscript, used if
\env{R\_GSCMD} is not set.
\item[\env{R\_USER}:] The user's `home' directory.  Set by
\R{}.  (\env{HOME} will be set to the same value if not already set.)

Evaluate an \R{} expression in a specified environment.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
eval(expr, envir = parent.frame(),
           enclos = if(is.list(envir) || is.pairlist(envir))
                       parent.frame() else baseenv())
evalq(expr, envir, enclos)
eval.parent(expr, n = 1)
local(expr, envir = new.env())
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{expr}] an object to be evaluated.  See `Details'.
\item[\code{envir}] the \code{\LinkA{environment}{environment}} in which \code{expr} is to
be evaluated.  May also be \code{NULL}, a list, a data frame,
a pairlist or an integer as specified to \code{\LinkA{sys.call}{sys.call}}.
\item[\code{enclos}] Relevant when \code{envir} is a (pair)list or a data frame.
Specifies the enclosure, i.e., where \R{} looks for objects not found
in \code{envir}.  This can be \code{NULL} (interpreted as the base
package environment, \code{\LinkA{baseenv}{baseenv}()}) or an environment.
\item[\code{n}] number of parent generations to go back
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{eval} evaluates the \code{expr} argument in the
environment specified by \code{envir} and returns the computed value.
If \code{envir} is not specified, then the default is
\code{\LinkA{parent.frame}{parent.frame}()} (the environment where the call to
\code{eval} was made).

Objects to be evaluated can be of types \code{\LinkA{call}{call}} or
\code{\LinkA{expression}{expression}} or \LinkA{name}{name} (when the name is looked
up in the current scope and its binding is evaluated), a \LinkA{promise}{promise}
or any of the basic types such as vectors, functions and environments
(which are returned unchanged).

The \code{evalq} form is equivalent to \code{eval(quote(expr), ...)}.
\code{eval} evaluates its first argument in the current scope
before passing it to the evaluator: \code{evalq} avoids this.

\code{eval.parent(expr, n)} is a shorthand for
\code{eval(expr, parent.frame(n))}.

If \code{envir} is a list (such as a data frame) or pairlist, it is
copied into a temporary environment (with enclosure \code{enclos}),
and the temporary environment is used for evaluation.  So if
\code{expr} changes any of the components named in the (pair)list, the
changes are lost.

If \code{envir} is \code{NULL} it is interpreted as an empty list so
no values could be found in \code{envir} and look-up goes directly to
\code{enclos}.

\code{local} evaluates an expression in a local environment.  It is
equivalent to \code{evalq} except that its default argument creates a
new, empty environment.  This is useful to create anonymous recursive
functions and as a kind of limited namespace feature since variables
defined in the environment are not visible from the outside.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
The result of evaluating the object: for an expression vector this is
the result of evaluating the last element.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
Due to the difference in scoping rules, there are some differences
between \R{} and S in this area.  In particular, the default enclosure
in S is the global environment.

When evaluating expressions in a data frame that has been passed as an
argument to a function, the relevant enclosure is often the caller's
environment, i.e., one needs
\code{eval(x, data, parent.frame())}.

%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] a variable name (given as a character string).
\item[\code{where}] where to look for the object (see the details section); if
omitted, the function will search as if the name of the object
appeared unquoted in an expression.
\item[\code{envir}] an alternative way to specify an environment to look in,
but it is usually simpler to just use the \code{where} argument.
\item[\code{frame}] a frame in the calling list.  Equivalent to giving
\code{where} as \code{sys.frame(frame)}.
\item[\code{mode}] the mode or type of object sought: see the
`Details' section.
\item[\code{inherits}] should the enclosing frames of the environment be
searched?
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The \code{where} argument can specify the environment in which to look
for the object in any of several ways: as an integer (the position in
the \code{\LinkA{search}{search}} list); as the character string name of an
element in the search list; or as an \code{\LinkA{environment}{environment}}
(including using \code{\LinkA{sys.frame}{sys.frame}} to access the currently active
function calls).  The \code{envir} argument is an alternative way to
specify an environment, but is primarily there for back compatibility.

This function looks to see if the name \code{x} has a value bound to
it in the specified environment.  If \code{inherits} is \code{TRUE} and
a value is not found for \code{x} in the specified environment, the
enclosing frames of the environment are searched until the name \code{x}
is encountered.  See \code{\LinkA{environment}{environment}} and the `R
Language Definition' manual for details about the structure of
environments and their enclosures.

\bold{Warning:}
\code{inherits = TRUE} is the default behaviour for \R{} but not for S.

If \code{mode} is specified then only objects of that type are sought.
The \code{mode} may specify one of the collections \code{"numeric"} and
\code{"function"} (see \code{\LinkA{mode}{mode}}): any member of the
collection will suffice.  (This is true even if a member of a
collection is specified, so for example \code{mode="special"} will
seek any type of function.)
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
Logical, true if and only if an object of the correct name and mode is
found.

individual calls etc.  The replacement forms of these operators can be

\code{is.expression} returns \code{TRUE} if \code{expr} is an
expression object and \code{FALSE} otherwise.

\code{as.expression} attempts to coerce its argument into an
expression object.  It is generic, and only the default method is
described here.  (The default method calls
\code{as.vector(type="expression")} and so may dispatch methods for
\code{\LinkA{as.vector}{as.vector}}.)  \code{NULL}, calls, symbols (see
\code{\LinkA{as.symbol}{as.symbol}}) and pairlists are returned as the element of
a length-one expression vector.  Atomic vectors are placed
element-by-element into an expression vector (without using any
names): lists are changed type to an expression vector (keeping all
attributes).  Other types are not currently supported.

\begin{Description}\relax
Operators acting on vectors, matrices, arrays and lists to extract or

\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
x[i]
x[i, j, ... , drop = TRUE]
x[[i, exact = TRUE]]
x[[i, j, ..., exact = TRUE]]
x$name
getElement(object, name)

x[i] <- value
x[i, j, ...] <- value
x[[i]] <- value
x$i <- value
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x, object}] 
object from which to extract element(s) or in which to replace element(s).

\item[\code{i, j, ...}] 
indices specifying elements to extract or replace.  Indices are
\code{numeric} or \code{character} vectors or empty (missing) or
\code{NULL}.  Numeric values are coerced to integer as by
\code{\LinkA{as.integer}{as.integer}} (and hence truncated towards zero).
Character vectors will be matched to the \code{\LinkA{names}{names}} of the
object (or for matrices/arrays, the \code{\LinkA{dimnames}{dimnames}}):
see `Character indices' below for further details.

For \code{[}-indexing only: \code{i}, \code{j}, \code{...} can be
logical vectors, indicating elements/slices to select.  Such vectors
are recycled if necessary to match the corresponding extent.
\code{i}, \code{j}, \code{...} can also be negative integers,
indicating elements/slices to leave out of the selection.

When indexing arrays by \code{[} a single argument \code{i} can be a
matrix with as many columns as there are dimensions of \code{x}; the
result is then a vector with elements corresponding to the sets of
indices in each row of \code{i}.

An index value of \code{NULL} is treated as if it were \code{integer(0)}.

\item[\code{name}] 
A literal character string or a \LinkA{name}{name} (possibly \LinkA{backtick}{backtick}
quoted).  For extraction, this is normally (see under
`Environments') partially matched to the \code{\LinkA{names}{names}}
of the object.

\item[\code{drop}] For matrices and arrays.  If \code{TRUE} the result is
coerced to the lowest possible dimension (see the examples).  This
only works for extracting elements, not for the replacement.  See
\code{\LinkA{drop}{drop}} for further details.

\item[\code{exact}] Controls possible partial matching of \code{[[} when
extracting by a character vector (for most objects, but see under
`Environments').  The default is no partial matching.  Value
\code{NA} allows partial matching but issues a warning when it
occurs.  Value \code{FALSE} allows partial matching without any
warning.
\item[\code{value}] typically an array-like \R{} object of a similar class as
\code{x}.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
These operators are generic.  You can write methods to handle indexing
of specific classes of objects, see \LinkA{InternalMethods}{InternalMethods} as well as
\code{\LinkA{[.data.frame}{[.data.frame}} and \code{\LinkA{[.factor}{[.factor}}.  The
descriptions here apply only to the default methods.  Note that
separate methods are required for the replacement functions
\code{[<-}, \code{[[<-} and \code{\$<-} for use when indexing occurs on
the assignment side of an expression.

The most important distinction between \code{[}, \code{[[} and
\code{\$} is that the \code{[} can select more than one element whereas
the other two select a single element.

The default methods work somewhat differently for atomic vectors,
matrices/arrays and for recursive (list-like, see
\code{\LinkA{is.recursive}{is.recursive}}) objects.  \code{\$} is only valid for
recursive objects, and is only discussed in the section below on
recursive objects.

Subsetting (except by an empty index) will drop all attributes except
\code{names}, \code{dim} and \code{dimnames}.

Indexing can occur on the right-hand-side of an expression for
extraction, or on the left-hand-side for replacement.  When an index
expression appears on the left side of an assignment (known as
\emph{subassignment}) then that part of \code{x} is set to the value
of the right hand side of the assignment.  In this case no partial
matching of character indices is done, and the left-hand-side is
coerced as needed to accept the values.  Attributes are preserved
(although \code{names}, \code{dim} and \code{dimnames} will be
adjusted suitably).  Subassignment is done sequentially, so if an
index is specified more than once the latest assigned value for an
index will result.

It is an error to apply any of these operators to an object which is
not subsettable (e.g. a function).
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Section}{Atomic vectors}
The usual form of indexing is \code{"["}.  \code{"[["} can be used to
select a single element \emph{dropping} \code{\LinkA{names}{names}}, whereas
\code{"["} keeps them, e.g., in \code{c(abc = 123)[1]}.

The index object \code{i} can be numeric, logical, character or empty.
Indexing by factors is allowed and is equivalent to indexing by the
numeric codes (see \code{\LinkA{factor}{factor}}) and not by the character
values which are printed (for which use \code{[as.character(i)]}).

An empty index selects all values: this is most often used to replace
all the entries but keep the \code{\LinkA{attributes}{attributes}}.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Matrices and arrays}
Matrices and arrays are vectors with a dimension attribute and so all
the vector forms of indexing can be used with a single index.  The
result will be an unnamed vector unless \code{x} is one-dimensional
when it will be a one-dimensional array.

The most common form of indexing a \eqn{k}{}-dimensional array is to
specify \eqn{k}{} indices to \code{[}.  As for vector indexing, the
indices can be numeric, logical, character, empty or even factor.
An empty index (a comma separated blank) indicates that all entries in
that dimension are selected.
The argument \code{drop} applies to this form of indexing.

A third form of indexing is via a numeric matrix with the one column
for each dimension: each row of the index matrix then selects a single
element of the array, and the result is a vector.  Negative indices are
not allowed in the index matrix.  \code{NA} and zero values are allowed:
rows of an index matrix containing a zero are ignored, whereas rows
containing an \code{NA} produce an \code{NA} in the result.

Indexing via a character matrix with one column per dimensions is also
supported if the array has dimension names.  As with numeric matrix
indexing, each row of the index matrix selects a single element of the
array.  Indices are matched against the appropriate dimension names.
\code{NA} is allowed and will produce an \code{NA} in the result.
Unmatched indices as well as the empty string (\code{""}) are not
allowed and will result in an error.

A vector obtained by matrix indexing will be unnamed unless \code{x}
is one-dimensional when the row names (if any) will be indexed to
provide names for the result.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Recursive (list-like) objects}
Indexing by \code{[} is similar to atomic vectors and selects a list
of the specified element(s).

Both \code{[[} and \code{\$} select a single element of the list.  The
main difference is that \code{\$} does not allow computed indices,
whereas \code{[[} does.  \code{x\$name} is equivalent to
\code{x[["name", exact = FALSE]]}.  Also, the partial matching
behavior of \code{[[} can be controlled using the \code{exact} argument.

\code{getElement(x, name)} is a version of \code{x[[name, exact = TRUE]]}
which for formally classed (S4) objects returns \code{\LinkA{slot}{slot}(x, name)},
hence providing access to even more general list-like objects.

\code{[} and \code{[[} are sometimes applied to other recursive
objects such as \LinkA{call}{call}s and \LinkA{expression}{expression}s.  Pairlists are
coerced to lists for extraction by \code{[}, but all three operators
can be used for replacement.

\code{[[} can be applied recursively to lists, so that if the single
index \code{i} is a vector of length \code{p}, \code{alist[[i]]} is
equivalent to \code{alist[[i1]]...[[ip]]} providing all but the
final indexing results in a list.

Note that in all three kinds of replacement, a value of \code{NULL}
deletes the corresponding item of the list.  To set entries to
\code{NULL}, you need \code{x[i] <- list(NULL)}.

When \code{\$<-} is applied to a \code{NULL} \code{x}, it first coerces
\code{x} to \code{list()}.  This is what also happens with \code{[[<-}
if the replacement value \code{value} is of length greater than one:
if \code{value} has length 1 or 0, \code{x} is first coerced to a
zero-length vector of the type of \code{value}.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Environments}
Both \code{\$} and \code{[[} can be applied to environments.  Only
character indices are allowed and no partial matching is done.  The
semantics of these operations are those of \code{get(i, env=x,
    inherits=FALSE)}.  If no match is found then \code{NULL} is
returned.  The replacement versions, \code{\$<-} and \code{[[<-}, can
also be used.  Again, only character arguments are allowed.  The
semantics in this case are those of \code{assign(i, value, env=x,
    inherits=FALSE)}.  Such an assignment will either create a new
binding or change the existing binding in \code{x}.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{NAs in indexing}
When extracting, a numerical, logical or character \code{NA} index picks
an unknown element and so returns \code{NA} in the corresponding
element of a logical, integer, numeric, complex or character result,
and \code{NULL} for a list.  (It returns \code{00} for a raw result.]

When replacing (that is using indexing on the lhs of an
assignment) \code{NA} does not select any element to be replaced.  As
there is ambiguity as to whether an element of the rhs should
be used or not, this is only allowed if the rhs value is of length one
(so the two interpretations would have the same outcome).
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Argument matching}
Note that these operations do not match their index arguments in the
standard way: argument names are ignored and positional matching only is
used.  So \code{m[j=2,i=1]} is equivalent to \code{m[2,1]} and
\strong{not} to \code{m[1,2]}.

This may not be true for methods defined for them; for example it is
not true for the \code{data.frame} methods described in
\code{\LinkA{[.data.frame}{[.data.frame}} which warn if \code{i} or \code{j}
is named and have undocumented behaviour in that case.

To avoid confusion, do not name index arguments (but \code{drop} and
\code{exact} must be named).
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{S4 methods}
These operators are also implicit S4 generics, but as primitives, S4
methods will be dispatched only on S4 objects \code{x}.









The implicit generics for the \code{\$} and \code{\$<-} operators do not
have \code{name} in their signature because the grammar only allows
symbols or string constants for the \code{name} argument.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Character indices}
Character indices can in some circumstances be partially matched (see
\code{\LinkA{pmatch}{pmatch}}) to the names or dimnames of the object being
subsetted (but never for subassignment).  Unlike S (Becker \emph{et
al} p. 358)), \R{} has never used partial matching when extracting by
\code{[}, and as from \R{} 2.7.0 partial matching is not by default used
by \code{[[} (see argument \code{exact}).

Thus the default behaviour is to use partial matching only when
extracting from recursive objects (except environments) by \code{\$}.
Even in that case, warnings can be switched on by
\code{\LinkA{options}{options}(warnPartialMatchAttr = TRUE)}.

Neither empty (\code{""}) nor \code{NA} indices match any names, not
even empty nor missing names.  If any object has no names or
appropriate dimnames, they are taken as all \code{""} and so match
nothing.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
The documented behaviour of S is that an \code{NA} replacement index
`goes nowhere' but uses up an element of \code{value}
(Becker \emph{et al} p. 359).  However, that has not been true of
other implementations.

%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] data frame.

\item[\code{i, j, ...}] elements to extract or replace.  For \code{[} and
\code{[[}, these are \code{numeric} or \code{character} or, for
\code{[} only, empty.  Numeric values are coerced to integer as if
by \code{\LinkA{as.integer}{as.integer}}.  For replacement by \code{[}, a logical
matrix is allowed.

\item[\code{name}] 
A literal character string or a \LinkA{name}{name} (possibly \LinkA{backtick}{backtick}
quoted).

\item[\code{drop}] logical.  If \code{TRUE} the result is coerced to the
lowest possible dimension.  The default is to drop if only one
column is left, but \bold{not} to drop if only one row is left.

\item[\code{value}] A suitable replacement value: it will be repeated a whole
number of times if necessary and it may be coerced: see the
Coercion section.  If \code{NULL}, deletes the column if a single
column is selected.

\item[\code{exact}] logical: see \code{\LinkA{[}{[}}, and applies to column names.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
Data frames can be indexed in several modes.  When \code{[} and
\code{[[} are used with a single index (\code{x[i]} or \code{x[[i]]}),
they index the data frame as if it were a list.  In this usage a
\code{drop} argument is ignored, with a warning.

Note that there is no \code{data.frame} method for \code{\$}, so
\code{x\$name} uses the default method which treats \code{x} as a
list.  There is a replacement method which checks \code{value} for
the correct number of rows, and replicates it if necessary.

When \code{[} and \code{[[} are used with two indices (\code{x[i, j]}
and \code{x[[i, j]]}) they act like indexing a matrix:  \code{[[} can
only be used to select one element.  Note that for each selected
column, \code{xj} say, typically (if it is not matrix-like), the
resulting column will be \code{xj[i]}, and hence rely on the
corresponding \code{[} method, see the examples section.

If \code{[} returns a data frame it will have unique (and non-missing)
row names, if necessary transforming the row names using
\code{\LinkA{make.unique}{make.unique}}.  Similarly, if columns are selected column
names will be transformed to be unique if necessary (e.g. if columns
are selected more than once, or if more than one column of a given
name is selected if the data frame has duplicate column names).

When \code{drop = TRUE}, this is applied to the subsetting of any
matrices contained in the data frame as well as to the data frame itself.

The replacement methods can be used to add whole column(s) by specifying
non-existent column(s), in which case the column(s) are added at the
right-hand edge of the data frame and numerical indices must be
contiguous to existing indices.  On the other hand, rows can be added
at any row after the current last row, and the columns will be
in-filled with missing values.  Missing values in the indices are not
allowed for replacement.

For \code{[} the replacement value can be a list: each element of the
list is used to replace (part of) one column, recycling the list as
necessary.  If columns specified by number are created, the names
(if any) of the corresponding list elements are used to name the
columns.  If the replacement is not selecting rows, list values can
contain \code{NULL} elements which will cause the corresponding
columns to be deleted.  (See the Examples.)

Matrix indexing (\code{x[i]} with a logical or a 2-column integer
matrix \code{i}) using \code{[} is not recommended, and barely
supported.  For extraction, \code{x} is first coerced to a matrix.
For replacement, a logical matrix (only) can be used to select the
elements to be replaced in the same way as for a matrix.

Both \code{[} and \code{[[} extraction methods partially match row
names.  By default neither partially match column names, but
\code{[[} will unless \code{exact=TRUE}.  If you want to do exact
matching on row names use \code{\LinkA{match}{match}} as in the examples.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
For \code{[} a data frame, list or a single column (the latter two
only when dimensions have been dropped).  If matrix indexing is used for
extraction a matrix results.  If the result would be a data frame an
error results if undefined columns are selected (as there is no general
concept of a 'missing' column in a data frame).  Otherwise if a single
column is selected and this is undefined the result is \code{NULL}.

For \code{[[} a column of the data frame or \code{NULL}
(extraction with one index)
or a length-one vector (extraction with two indices).

For \code{\$}, a column of the data frame (or \code{NULL}).

For \code{[<-}, \code{[[<-} and \code{\$<-}, a data frame.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{Coercion}
The story over when replacement values are coerced is a complicated
one, and one that has changed during \R{}'s development.  This section
is a guide only.

When \code{[} and \code{[[} are used to add or replace a whole column,
no coercion takes place but \code{value} will be
replicated (by calling the generic function \code{\LinkA{rep}{rep}}) to the
right length if an exact number of repeats can be used.

When \code{[} is used with a logical matrix, each value is coerced to
the type of the column into which it is to be placed.

When  \code{[} and \code{[[} are used with two indices, the
column will be coerced as necessary to accommodate the value.

Note that when the replacement value is an array (including a matrix)
it is \emph{not} treated as a series of columns (as
\code{\LinkA{data.frame}{data.frame}} and \code{\LinkA{as.data.frame}{as.data.frame}} do) but
inserted as a single column.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Warning}
The default behaviour when only one \emph{row} is left is equivalent to
specifying \code{drop = FALSE}.  To drop from a data frame to a list,
\code{drop = TRUE} has to be specified explicitly.

Arguments other than \code{drop} and \code{exact} should not be named:
there is a warning if they are and the behaviour differs from the
description here.

\item[\code{na.rm}] a logical indicating whether missing values should be
removed.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{max} and \code{min} return the maximum or minimum of \emph{all}
the  values present in their arguments, as \code{\LinkA{integer}{integer}} if
all are \code{logical} or \code{integer}, as \code{\LinkA{double}{double}} if
all are numeric, and character otherwise.

If \code{na.rm} is \code{FALSE} an \code{NA} value in any of the
arguments will cause a value of \code{NA} to be returned, otherwise
\code{NA} values are ignored.

The minimum and maximum of a numeric empty set are \code{+Inf} and
\code{-Inf} (in this order!) which ensures \emph{transitivity}, e.g.,
\code{min(x1, min(x2)) == min(x1, x2)}.  For numeric \code{x}
\code{max(x) == -Inf} and \code{min(x) == +Inf}
whenever \code{length(x) == 0} (after removing missing values if
requested).  However, \code{pmax} and \code{pmin} return
\code{NA} if all the parallel elements are \code{NA} even for
\code{na.rm = TRUE}.

\code{pmax} and \code{pmin} take one or more vectors (or matrices) as
arguments and return a single vector giving the `parallel'
maxima (or minima) of the vectors.  The first element of the result is
the maximum (minimum) of the first elements of all the arguments, the
second element of the result is the maximum (minimum) of the second
elements of all the arguments and so on.  Shorter inputs (of non-zero
length) are recycled if necessary.  Attributes (see
\code{\LinkA{attributes}{attributes}}: such as \code{\LinkA{names}{names}} or
\code{\LinkA{dim}{dim}}) are copied from the first argument (if applicable).

\code{pmax.int} and \code{pmin.int} are faster internal versions only
used when all arguments are atomic vectors and there are no classes:
they drop all attributes.  (Note that all versions fail for raw and
complex vectors since these have no ordering.)

\code{max} and \code{min} are generic functions: methods can be
defined for them individually or via the
\code{\LinkA{Summary}{S3groupGeneric}} group generic.  For this to
work properly, the arguments \code{...} should be unnamed, and
dispatch is on the first argument.

By definition the min/max of a numeric vector containing an \code{NaN}
is \code{NaN}, except that the min/max of any vector containing an
\code{NA} is \code{NA} even if it also contains an \code{NaN}.
Note that \code{max(NA, Inf) == NA} even though the maximum would be
\code{Inf} whatever the missing value actually is.

Character versions are sorted lexicographically, and this depends on
the collating sequence of the locale in use: the help for
`\LinkA{Comparison}{Comparison}' gives details.  The max/min of an empty
character vector is defined to be character \code{NA}.  (One could
argue that as \code{""} is the smallest character element, the maximum
should be \code{""}, but there is no obvious candidate for the
minimum.)
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
For \code{min} or \code{max}, a length-one vector.  For \code{pmin} or
\code{pmax}, a vector of length the longest of the input vectors, or
length zero if one of the inputs had zero length.

The type of the result will be that of the highest of the inputs in
the hierarchy integer < real < character.

For \code{min} and \code{max} if there are only numeric inputs and all
are empty (after possible removal of \code{NA}s), the result is double
(\code{Inf} or \code{-Inf}).
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{S4 methods}
\code{max} and \code{min} are part of the S4
\code{\LinkA{Summary}{S4groupGeneric}} group generic.  Methods
for them must use the signature \code{x, ..., na.rm}.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
`Numeric' arguments are vectors of type integer and numeric,
and logical (coerced to integer).  For historical reasons, \code{NULL}
is accepted as equivalent to \code{integer(0)}.

\code{pmax} and \code{pmin} will also work on classed objects with
appropriate methods for comparison, \code{is.na} and \code{rep} (if
recycling of arguments is needed).

\begin{Description}\relax
The function \code{factor} is used to encode a vector as a factor (the
terms `category' and `enumerated type' are also used for
factors).  If argument \code{ordered} is \code{TRUE}, the factor
levels are assumed to be ordered.  For compatibility with S there is
also a function \code{ordered}.

\code{is.factor}, \code{is.ordered}, \code{as.factor} and \code{as.ordered}
are the membership and coercion functions for these classes.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
factor(x = character(), levels, labels = levels,
       exclude = NA, ordered = is.ordered(x))

ordered(x, ...)

is.factor(x)
is.ordered(x)

as.factor(x)
as.ordered(x)

addNA(x, ifany = FALSE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] a vector of data, usually taking a small number of distinct
values.
\item[\code{levels}] an optional vector of the values that \code{x} might
have taken.  The default is the unique set of values taken by
\code{\LinkA{as.character}{as.character}(x)}, sorted into increasing order \emph{of
\code{x}}.  Note that this set can be smaller than
\code{sort(unique(x))}.
\item[\code{labels}] \emph{either} an optional vector of labels for the
levels (in the same order as \code{levels} after removing those in
\code{exclude}), \emph{or} a character string of length 1.
\item[\code{exclude}] a vector of values to be excluded when forming the
set of levels.  This should be of the same type as \code{x}, and
will be coerced if necessary.
\item[\code{ordered}] logical flag to determine if the levels should be regarded
as ordered (in the order given).
\item[\code{...}] (in \code{ordered(.)}): any of the above, apart from
\code{ordered} itself.
\item[\code{ifany}] (only add an \code{NA} level if it is used, i.e.
if \code{any(is.na(x))}.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The type of the vector \code{x} is not restricted; it only must have
an \code{\LinkA{as.character}{as.character}} method and be sortable (by
\code{\LinkA{sort.list}{sort.list}}).

Ordered factors differ from factors only in their class, but methods
and the model-fitting functions treat the two classes quite differently.

The encoding of the vector happens as follows.  First all the values
in \code{exclude} are removed from \code{levels}. If \code{x[i]}
equals \code{levels[j]}, then the \code{i}-th element of the result is
\code{j}.  If no match is found for \code{x[i]} in \code{levels}
(which will happen for excluded values) then the \code{i}-th element
of the result is set to \code{\LinkA{NA}{NA}}.

Normally the `levels' used as an attribute of the result are
the reduced set of levels after removing those in \code{exclude}, but
this can be altered by supplying \code{labels}.  This should either
be a set of new labels for the levels, or a character string, in
which case the levels are that character string with a sequence
number appended.

\code{factor(x, exclude=NULL)} applied to a factor is a no-operation
unless there are unused levels: in that case, a factor with the
reduced level set is returned.  If \code{exclude} is used it should
also be a factor with the same level set as \code{x} or a set of codes
for the levels to be excluded.

The codes of a factor may contain \code{\LinkA{NA}{NA}}.  For a numeric
\code{x}, set \code{exclude=NULL} to make \code{\LinkA{NA}{NA}} an extra
level (prints as \code{<NA>}); by default, this is the last level.

If \code{NA} is a level, the way to set a code to be missing (as
opposed to the code of the missing level) is to
use \code{\LinkA{is.na}{is.na}} on the left-hand-side of an assignment (as in
\code{is.na(f)[i] <- TRUE}; indexing inside \code{is.na} does not work).
Under those circumstances missing values are currently printed as
\code{<NA>}, i.e., identical to entries of level \code{NA}.

\code{is.factor} is generic: you can write methods to handle
specific classes of objects, see \LinkA{InternalMethods}{InternalMethods}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{factor} returns an object of class \code{"factor"} which has a
set of integer codes the length of \code{x} with a \code{"levels"}
attribute of mode \code{\LinkA{character}{character}} and unique
(\code{!\LinkA{anyDuplicated}{anyDuplicated}(.)}) entries.  If argument \code{ordered}
is true (or \code{ordered()} is used) the result has class
\code{c("ordered", "factor")}.

Applying \code{factor} to an ordered or unordered factor returns a
factor (of the same type) with just the levels which occur: see also
\code{\LinkA{[.factor}{[.factor}} for a more transparent way to achieve this.

\code{is.factor} returns \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} depending on
whether its argument is of type factor or not.  Correspondingly,
\code{is.ordered} returns \code{TRUE} when its argument is an ordered
factor and \code{FALSE} otherwise.

\code{as.factor} coerces its argument to a factor.
It is an abbreviated form of \code{factor}.

\code{as.ordered(x)} returns \code{x} if this is ordered, and
\code{ordered(x)} otherwise.

\code{addNA} modifies a factor by turning \code{NA} into an extra
level (so that \code{NA} values are counted in tables, for instance).
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{Warning}
The interpretation of a factor depends on both the codes and the
\code{"levels"} attribute.  Be careful only to compare factors with
the same set of levels (in the same order).  In particular,
\code{as.numeric} applied to a factor is meaningless, and may
happen by implicit coercion.  To transform a factor \code{f} to
approximately its original numeric values,
\code{as.numeric(levels(f))[f]} is recommended and slightly more
efficient than \code{as.numeric(as.character(f))}.

The levels of a factor are by default sorted, but the sort order
may well depend on the locale at the time of creation, and should
not be assumed to be ASCII.

There are some anomalies associated with factors that have
\code{NA} as a level.  It is suggested to use them sparingly, e.g.,
only for tabulation purposes.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Comparison operators and group generic methods}
There are \code{"factor"} and \code{"ordered"} methods for the
\LinkA{group generic}{group generic} \code{\LinkA{Ops}{S3groupGeneric}} which
provide methods for the \LinkA{Comparison}{Comparison} operators,
and for the \code{\LinkA{min}{min}},\code{\LinkA{max}{max}}, and
\code{\LinkA{range}{range}} generics in \code{\LinkA{Summary}{S3groupGeneric}}
of \code{"ordered"}.  (The rest of the groups and the
\code{\LinkA{Math}{S3groupGeneric}} group generate an error as they
are not meaningful for factors.)

Only \code{==} and \code{!=} can be used for factors: a factor can
only be compared to another factor with an identical set of levels
(not necessarily in the same ordering) or to a character vector.
Ordered factors are compared in the same way, but the general dispatch
mechanism precludes comparing ordered and unordered factors.

All the comparison operators are available for ordered factors.
Collation is done by the levels of the operands: if both operands are
ordered factors they must have the same level set.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
In earlier versions of \R{}, storing character data as a factor was more
space efficient if there is even a small proportion of
repeats.  However, identical character strings share storage, so
the difference is now small in most cases.  (Integer values are stored
in 4 bytes whereas each reference to a character string needs a
pointer of 4 or 8 bytes.)

Please note that it is not a good idea to use this function to test
before trying to open a file.  On a multi-tasking system, it is
possible that the accessibility of a file will change between the time
you call \code{file.access()} and the time you try to open the file.

What constitutes a `file' is OS-dependent but includes
directories.  (However, directory names must not include a trailing
backslash or slash on Windows.)  See also the section in the help for
\code{\LinkA{file.exists}{file.exists}} on case-insensitive file systems.

The file `mode' follows POSIX conventions, giving three octal
digits summarizing the permissions for the file owner, the owner's
group and for anyone respectively.  Each digit is the logical
\emph{or} of read (4), write (2) and execute/search (1) permissions.

File modes are probably only useful on NTFS file systems, and it seems
all three digits refer to the file's owner.
The execute/search bits are set for directories, and for files based

\begin{Value}
A data frame with row names the file names and columns
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{size}] double: File size in bytes.
\item[\code{isdir}] logical: Is the file a directory?
\item[\code{mode}] integer of class \code{"octmode"}.  The file permissions,
printed in octal, for example \code{644}.
\item[\code{mtime, ctime, atime}] integer of class \code{"POSIXct"}:
file modification, `last status change' and last access times.
\end{ldescription}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{exe}] character: what sort of executable is this?  Possible
values are \code{"no"}, \code{"msdos"}, \code{"win16"},
\code{"win32"}, \code{"win64"} and \code{"unknown"}.  Note that a
file (e.g. a script file) can be executable according to the mode
bits but not executable in this sense.

\end{ldescription}
Entries for non-existent or non-readable files will be \code{NA}.

What is meant by the three file times depends on the OS and file
system.  On Windows native file systems \code{ctime} is the file
creation time (something which is not recorded on most Unix-alike file
systems).  What is meant by `file access' and hence the
`last access time' is system-dependent.

The times are reported to an accuracy of seconds, and perhaps more on
some systems.  However, many file systems only record times in
seconds, and some (e.g. modification time on FAT systems) are recorded
in increments of 2 or more seconds.

\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
This function provides the core of the R help system, but it can be
used for other purposes as well, such as \code{\LinkA{page}{page}}.

How the pager is implemented is highly system-dependent.

The basic Unix version concatenates the files (using the headers) to a
temporary file, and displays it in the pager selected by the
\code{pager} argument, which is a character vector specifying a system
command to run on the set of files.  The `factory-fresh'
default is to use \file{R\_HOME/bin/pager}, which is a shell script
running the command specified by the environment variable \env{PAGER}
whose default is set at configuration, usually to \command{less}.  On a
Unix-alike \command{more} is used if \code{pager} is empty.

Most GUI systems will use a separate pager window for each file, and
let the user leave it up while \R{} continues running.  The selection of
such pagers could either be done using special pager names being
intercepted by lower-level code (such as \code{"internal"} and
\code{"console"} on Windows), or by letting \code{pager} be an \R{}
function which will be called with arguments \code{(files, header,
    title, delete.file)} corresponding to the first four arguments of
\code{file.show} and take care of interfacing to the GUI.

The \command{R.app} Mac OS X GUI uses its internal pager irrespective
of the setting of \code{pager}.

Not all implementations will honour \code{delete.file}.  In
particular, using an external pager on Windows does not, as there is
no way to know when the external application has finished with the
file.

\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The \code{...} arguments are concatenated to form one character
string: you can specify the files separately or as one vector.
All of these functions expand path names: see \code{\LinkA{path.expand}{path.expand}}.

\code{file.create} creates files with the given names if they do not
already exist and truncates them if they do.  They are created with
the maximal read/write permissions allowed by the
`\LinkA{umask}{umask}' setting (where relevant).  By default a warning
is given (with the reason) if the operation fails.

\code{file.exists} returns a logical vector indicating whether the
files named by its argument exist.  (Here `exists' is in the
sense of the system's \code{stat} call: a file will be reported as
existing only if you have the permissions needed by \code{stat}.
Existence can also be checked by \code{\LinkA{file.access}{file.access}}, which
might use different permissions and so obtain a different result.
Note that the existence of a file does not imply that it is readable:
for that use \code{\LinkA{file.access}{file.access}}.)  What constitutes a
`file' is system-dependent, but should include directories.
(However, directory names must not include a trailing backslash or
slash on Windows.)  Note that if the file is a symbolic link on a
Unix-alike, the result indicates if the link points to an actual file,
not just if the link exists.
Lastly, note the \emph{different} function \code{\LinkA{exists}{exists}} which
checks for existence of \R{} objects.

\code{file.remove} attempts to remove the files named in its argument.
On most Unix platforms `file' includes \emph{empty}
directories, symbolic links, fifos and sockets.  On Windows,
`file' means a regular file and not, say, an empty directory.

\code{file.rename} attempts to rename files (and \code{from} and
\code{to} must be of the same length).  Where file permissions allow
this will overwrite an existing element of \code{to}.  This is subject
to the limitations of the OS's corresponding system call (see
something like \command{man 2 rename} on a Unix-alike): in particular
in the interpretation of `file': most platforms will not rename
files across file systems.  (On Windows, \code{file.rename} can move
files but not directories between volumes.)  On platforms which allow
directories to be renamed, typically neither or both of \code{from}
and \code{to} must a directory, and if \code{to} exists it must be an
empty directory.

\code{file.append} attempts to append the files named by its
second argument to those named by its first.  The \R{} subscript
recycling rule is used to align names given in vectors
of different lengths.

\code{file.copy} works in a similar way to \code{file.append} but with
the arguments in the natural order for copying.  Copying to existing
destination files is skipped unless \code{overwrite = TRUE}.  The
\code{to} argument can specify a single existing directory.  If
\code{copy.mode = TRUE} (added in \R{} 2.13.0) file read/write/execute
permissions are copied where possible, restricted by
`\LinkA{umask}{umask}'.  Other security attributes such as ACLs are not
copied.  On a POSIX filesystem the targets of symbolic links will be
copied rather than the links themselves.

\code{file.symlink} and \code{file.link} make symbolic and hard links
on those file systems which support them.  For \code{file.symlink} the
\code{to} argument can specify a single existing directory.  (Unix and
Mac OS X native filesystems support both.  Windows has hard links to
files on NTFS file systems and concepts related to symbolic links on
recent versions: see the section below on the Windows version of this
help page.  What happens on a FAT or SMB-mounted file system is OS-specific.)
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
These functions return a logical vector indicating which
operation succeeded for each of the files attempted.  Using a missing
value for a file or path name will always be regarded as a failure.

If \code{showWarnings = TRUE}, \code{file.create} will give a warning
for an unexpected failure.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{Case-insensitive file systems}
Case-insensitive file systems are the norm on Windows and Mac OS X,
but can be found on all OSes (for example a FAT-formatted USB drive is
probably case-insensitive).

These functions will most likely match existing files regardless of case
on such file systems: however this is an OS function and it is
possible that file names might be mapped to upper or lower case.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Symbolic links on Windows}
 Symbolic links in the sense of
POSIX file systems do not exist on Windows: however, NTFS file systems
support two similar concepts.

Windows 2000 and later have `junctions' (or
`junction points'), unfortunately without a public API.  They
are a Windows version of the Unix concept of mounting one directory on
another.  One way to create, list and delete junctions is \emph{via}
\file{junction.exe} from
\url{http://download.sysinternals.com/Files/Junction.zip} (see
\url{http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896768}).  On
recent enough versions of Windows \command{mklink /J} can also be
used.  Function \code{Sys.junction} (added in \R{} 2.15.0) creates one
or more junctions: \code{to} should either specify a single existing
directory or a set of non-existent file paths of the same length as
\code{from}.

A version of symbolic linking to files/directories was implemented
starting with Vista, and \code{file.symlink} makes use of that
interface since \R{} 2.15.0.  However, it has restrictions (apart from
the OS version restriction) which are crippling.  First, the user
needs permission to make symbolic links, and that permission is not
normally granted except to Administrator accounts (note: not users
with Administrator rights): further many users report that whereas the
Policy Editor appears to be able to grant such rights, the API still
reports insufficient permissions.  Second, the interface needs to know
if \code{from} is a file or a directory (and it need not yet exist):
we have implemented this to allow linking from a directory only if it
currently exists.

Care is needed with removing a junction (and most likely also a
symbolic link): many tools will remove the target and its contents
(including Windows Explorer in XP, and \code{unlink} in \R{} prior to
2.15.0).

There is no guarantee that these functions will handle Windows
relative paths of the form \file{d:path}: try \file{d:./path}
instead.  In particular, \file{d:} is not recognized as a directory.
Nor are \samp{\bsl{}\bsl{}?\bsl{}} prefixes (and similar) supported.

Most of these functions accept UTF-8 filepaths not valid in the
current locale.

User error in supplying invalid file names (and note that \file{foo/}
and \file{foo\bsl{}} \emph{are} invalid on Windows) has undefined consequences.

\item[\code{use\_umask}] logical: should the mode be restricted by the
\code{umask} setting?
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{dir.create} creates the last element of the path, unless
\code{recursive = TRUE}.  Trailing path separators are discarded.
On Windows drives are allowed in the path specification and unless
the path is rooted, it will be interpreted relative to the current
directory on that drive.  \code{mode} is ignored on Windows.

One of the idiosyncrasies of Windows is that directory creation may
report success but create a directory with a different name, for
example \code{dir.create("G.S.")} creates \file{"G.S"}.  This is
undocumented, and what are the precise circumstances is unknown (and
might depend on the version of Windows).  Also avoid directory names
with a trailing space.



\code{Sys.chmod} sets the file permissions of one or more files.
The interpretation of \code{mode} in the Windows system functions is
non-POSIX and only supports setting the read-only attribute of the
file.  So \R{} interprets \code{mode} to mean set read-only if and only
if \code{(mode \& 0200) == 0} (interpreted in octal).  Windows has a much
more extensive system of file permissions on some file systems
(e.g. versions of NTFS) which are unrelated to this system call.

\code{Sys.umask} sets the \code{umask} and returns the previous value:
as a special case \code{mode = NA} just returns the current value.
All files on Windows are regarded as readable, and files being
executable is not a Windows concept.  So \code{umask} only controls
whether a file is writable: a setting of \code{"200"} makes files (but
not directories) created subsequently read-only.


How modes are handled depends on the file system, even on Unix-alikes
(although their documentation is often written assuming a POSIX file
system).  So treat documentation cautiously if you are using, say, a
FAT/FAT32 or network-mounted file system. 
\end{Details}

\begin{Value}
\code{dir.create} and \code{Sys.chmod} return invisibly a logical vector

exists.  If \code{showWarnings = TRUE}, \code{dir.create} will give a
warning for an unexpected failure (e.g. not for a missing value nor
for an already existing component for \code{recursive = TRUE}).

\code{Sys.umask} returns the previous value of the \code{umask},
as a length-one object of class \code{"\LinkA{octmode}{octmode}"}: the
visibility flag is off unless \code{mode} is \code{NA}.

\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] numeric.
\item[\code{vec}] numeric, sorted (weakly) increasingly, of length \code{N},
say.
\item[\code{rightmost.closed}] logical; if true, the rightmost interval,
\code{vec[N-1] .. vec[N]} is treated as \emph{closed}, see below.
\item[\code{all.inside}] logical; if true, the returned indices are coerced
into \code{1,...,N-1}, i.e., \code{0} is mapped to \code{1}
and \code{N} to \code{N-1}.

\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The function \code{findInterval} finds the index of one vector \code{x} in
another, \code{vec}, where the latter must be non-decreasing.  Where
this is trivial, equivalent to \code{apply( outer(x, vec, ">="), 1, sum)},
as a matter of fact, the internal algorithm uses interval search
ensuring \eqn{O(n \log N)}{} complexity where
\code{n <- length(x)} (and \code{N <- length(vec)}).  For (almost)
sorted \code{x}, it will be even faster, basically \eqn{O(n)}{}.

This is the same computation as for the empirical distribution
function, and indeed, \code{findInterval(t, sort(X))} is
\emph{identical} to \eqn{n F_n(t; X_1,\dots,X_n)}{} where \eqn{F_n}{} is the empirical distribution
function of \eqn{X_1,\dots,X_n}{}.

When \code{rightmost.closed = TRUE}, the result for \code{x[j] = vec[N]}
(\eqn{ = \max vec}{}), is \code{N - 1} as for all other
values in the last interval.
\end{Details}

\begin{Value}
vector of length \code{length(x)} with values in \code{0:N} (and

\code{1:(N-1)} if and only if \code{all.inside = TRUE} (equivalently coercing all
x values \emph{inside} the intervals).  Note that \code{\LinkA{NA}{NA}}s are
propagated from \code{x}, and \code{\LinkA{Inf}{Inf}} values are allowed in
both \code{x} and \code{vec}.

\code{force} forces the evaluation of a formal argument.  This can

\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{.NAME}] a character string giving the name of a C function or
Fortran subroutine, or an object of class
\code{"\LinkA{NativeSymbolInfo}{NativeSymbolInfo}"}, \code{"\LinkA{RegisteredNativeSymbol}{RegisteredNativeSymbol}"}
or \code{"\LinkA{NativeSymbol}{NativeSymbol}"} referring to such a name.
\item[\code{...}] arguments to be passed to the foreign function.  Up to 65.
\item[\code{NAOK}] if \code{TRUE} then any \code{\LinkA{NA}{NA}} or
\code{\LinkA{NaN}{NaN}} or \code{\LinkA{Inf}{Inf}} values in the arguments are
passed on to the foreign function.  If \code{FALSE}, the presence of
\code{NA} or \code{NaN} or \code{Inf} values is regarded as an error.
\item[\code{DUP}] if \code{TRUE} then arguments are duplicated before
their address is passed to C or Fortran.
\item[\code{PACKAGE}] if supplied, confine the search for a character string
\code{.NAME} to the DLL given by this argument (plus the
conventional extension, \file{.so}, \file{.dll}, \dots).

This is intended to add safety for packages, which can ensure by
using this argument that no other package can override their external
symbols, and also speeds up the search (see `Note').

\item[\code{ENCODING}] optional name for an encoding to be assumed for
character vectors.  Allowed but ignored for \code{.Fortran},
deprecated for \code{.C}.  See `Details'.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
These functions can be used to make calls to compiled C and Fortran 77
code.  Later interfaces are \code{\LinkA{.Call}{.Call}} and
\code{\LinkA{.External}{.External}} which are more flexible and have better
performance.

Character strings will be translated from the value of \code{ENCODING}
or any declared encoding (see \code{\LinkA{Encoding}{Encoding}}) to the current
locale before being passed to the compiled C code.  They will be
returned encoded in the current locale unless \code{ENCODING} was
specified, when the output strings are translated to the specified
encoding.  This is deprecated: convert code to use \code{\LinkA{iconv}{iconv}}.

These functions are \LinkA{primitive}{primitive}, and \code{.NAME} is always
matched to the first argument supplied (which should not be named and
there will be a warning if it is---and an error in future.).
The other named arguments follow \code{...} and so cannot be
abbreviated.  For clarity, should avoid using names in the arguments
passed to \code{...} that match or partially match \code{.NAME}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
A list similar to the \code{...} list of arguments passed in
(including any names given to the arguments), but reflecting any
changes made by the C or Fortran code.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{Argument types}
The mapping of the types of \R{} arguments to C or Fortran arguments is


\Tabular{lll}{
\R{} &     C &     Fortran\\{}
integer & int * & integer\\{}
numeric & double * & double precision\\{}
-- or -- & float * & real\\{}
complex & Rcomplex * & double complex\\{}
logical & int * & integer \\{}
character & char ** & [see below]\\{}
raw & unsigned char * & not allowed\\{}
list & SEXP *& not allowed\\{}
other & SEXP& not allowed\\{}
}

Numeric vectors in \R{} will be passed as type \code{double *} to C (and
as \code{double precision} to Fortran) unless (i) \code{DUP} is true
and (ii) the argument has attribute \code{Csingle} set to \code{TRUE}
(use \code{\LinkA{as.single}{as.single}} or \code{\LinkA{single}{single}}).  This mechanism
is only intended to be used to facilitate the interfacing of existing
C and Fortran code.

The C type \code{Rcomplex} is defined in \file{Complex.h} as a
\code{typedef struct \{double r; double i;\}}.  It may or may not be
equivalent to the C99 \code{double complex} type, depending on the
compiler used.

Logical values are sent as \code{0} (\code{FALSE}), \code{1}
(\code{TRUE}) or \code{INT\_MIN = -2147483648} (\code{NA}, but only if
\code{NAOK = TRUE}), and the compiled code should return one of these
three values: however non-zero values other than \code{INT\_MIN} are
mapped to \code{TRUE}.

\emph{Note:} The C types corresponding to \code{integer} and
\code{logical} are \code{int}, not \code{long} as in S.  This
difference matters on most 64-bit platforms, where \code{int} is
32-bit and \code{long} is 64-bit (but not on 64-bit Windows).

\emph{Note:} The Fortran type corresponding to \code{logical} is
\code{integer}, not \code{logical}: the difference matters on some
Fortran compilers.

Missing (\code{NA}) string values are passed to \code{.C} as the string
"NA". As the C \code{char} type can represent all possible bit patterns
there appears to be no way to distinguish missing strings from the
string \code{"NA"}.  If this distinction is important use \code{\LinkA{.Call}{.Call}}.

\code{.Fortran} passes the first (only )character string of a character
vector is passed as a C character array to Fortran: that may be usable
as \code{character*255} if its true length is passed separately.  Only
up to 255 characters of the string are passed back.  (How well this
works, and even if it works at all, depends on the C and Fortran
compilers and the platform.)

Lists, functions are other \R{} objects can (for historical reasons) be
passed to \code{.C}, but the \code{\LinkA{.Call}{.Call}} interface is much
preferred.  All inputs apart from atomic vectors should be regarded as
read-only, and all apart from vectors (including lists), functions and
environments are now deprecated.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Warning}
\emph{\code{DUP = FALSE} is dangerous.}

People concerned about memory usage are strongly recommended to use
the \code{\LinkA{.Call}{.Call}} interface instead of these interfaces.

If you pass a local variable to \code{.C}/\code{.Fortran} with
\code{DUP = FALSE}, your compiled code can alter the local variable and
not just the copy in the return list.  Worse, if you pass a local
variable that is a formal parameter of the calling function, you may
be able to change not only the local variable but the variable one
level up.  This will be very hard to trace.

Character vectors cannot be used with \code{DUP = FALSE}.

It is safe and useful to set \code{DUP = FALSE} if you do not change any
of the variables that might be affected, e.g.,

\code{.C("Cfunction", input = x, output = numeric(10))}.

In this case the \code{output} variable did not exist before the call
so it cannot cause trouble (but as from \R{} 2.15.1 it is not copied
even with \code{DUP = TRUE}).  If the \code{input} variable is not
changed in the C code of \code{Cfunction} you are safe.

Note that if \code{DUP = TRUE} there are up to two copies involved.
Prior to \R{} 2.15.1 this was always the case for vectors (one before
calling the compiled code and one to collect the results), and this is
still the case for character vectors.  For other atomic vectors, the
argument is not copied before calling the compiled code if it is not
otherwise used in the calling code (such as \code{output} in the
example above).  Non-atomic-vector objects are read-only to the C code
and are never copied.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Fortran symbol names}
All Fortran compilers known to be usable to compile \R{} map symbol names
to lower case, and so does \code{.Fortran}.

Symbol names containing underscores are not valid Fortran 77 (although
they are valid in Fortran 9x).  Many Fortran 77 compilers will allow
them but may translate them in a different way to names not containing
underscores.  Such names will often work with \code{.Fortran} (since
how they are translated is detected when \R{} is built and the
information used by \code{.Fortran}), but portable code should not use
Fortran names containing underscores.

Use \code{.Fortran} with care for compiled Fortran 9x code: it may not
work if the Fortran 9x compiler used differs from the Fortran 77 compiler
used when configuring \R{}, especially if the subroutine name is not
lower-case or includes an underscore.  It is also possible to use
\code{.C} and do any necessary symbol-name translation yourself.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
If one of these functions is to be used frequently, do specify
\code{PACKAGE} (to confine the search to a single DLL) or pass
\code{.NAME} as one of the native symbol objects.  Searching for
symbols can take a long time, especially when many namespaces are loaded.

You may see \code{PACKAGE = "base"} for symbols linked into \R{}.  Do
not use this in your own code: such symbols are not part of the API
and may be changed without warning.

\code{PACKAGE = ""} is accepted, but will become an error in \R{} 2.16.0.

The way \LinkA{pairlist}{pairlist}s were passed by \code{.C} prior to \R{} 2.15.0
was not as documented.  This has been corrected, but the
\code{\LinkA{.Call}{.Call}} and \code{\LinkA{.External}{.External}} interfaces are much
preferred for passing anything other than atomic vectors.

\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] any \R{} object (conceptually); typically numeric.
\item[\code{trim}] logical; if \code{FALSE}, logical, numeric and complex
values are right-justified to a common width: if \code{TRUE} the
leading blanks for justification are suppressed.
\item[\code{digits}] how many significant digits are to be used for
numeric and complex \code{x}.  The default, \code{NULL}, uses
\code{\LinkA{getOption}{getOption}(digits)}.  This is a suggestion: enough decimal
places will be used so that the smallest (in magnitude) number has
this many significant digits, and also to satisfy \code{nsmall}.
(For the interpretation for complex numbers see \code{\LinkA{signif}{signif}}.)
\item[\code{nsmall}] the minimum number of digits to the right of the decimal
point in formatting real/complex numbers in non-scientific formats.
Allowed values are \code{0 <= nsmall <= 20}.
\item[\code{justify}] should a \emph{character} vector be left-justified (the
default), right-justified, centred or left alone.
\item[\code{width}] \code{default} method: the \emph{minimum} field width or
\code{NULL} or \code{0} for no restriction.

\code{AsIs} method: the \emph{maximum} field width for non-character
objects.  \code{NULL} corresponds to the default 12.

\item[\code{na.encode}] logical: should \code{NA} strings be encoded?  Note
this only applies to elements of character vectors, not to numerical
or logical \code{NA}s, which are always encoded as \code{"NA"}.

\item[\code{scientific}] Either a logical specifying whether
elements of a real or complex vector should be encoded in scientific
format, or an integer penalty (see \code{\LinkA{options}{options}("scipen")}).
Missing values correspond to the current default penalty.
\item[\code{...}] further arguments passed to or from other methods.

\item[\code{big.mark, big.interval, small.mark,
small.interval, decimal.mark, zero.print, drop0trailing}] 
used for prettying (longish) decimal sequences, passed to
\code{\LinkA{prettyNum}{prettyNum}}: that help page explains the details.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{format} is a generic function.  Apart from the methods described
here there are methods for dates (see \code{\LinkA{format.Date}{format.Date}}),
date-times (see \code{\LinkA{format.POSIXct}{format.POSIXct}})) and for other classes such
as \code{format.octmode} and \code{format.dist}.

\code{format.data.frame} formats the data frame column by column,
applying the appropriate method of \code{format} for each column.
Methods for columns are often similar to \code{as.character} but offer
more control.  Matrix and data-frame columns will be converted to
separate columns in the result, and character columns (normally all)
will be given class \code{"\LinkA{AsIs}{AsIs}"}.

\code{format.factor} converts the factor to a character vector and
then calls the default method (and so \code{justify} applies).

\code{format.AsIs} deals with columns of complicated objects that
have been extracted from a data frame.  Character objects are passed
to the default method (and so \code{width} does not apply).
Otherwise it calls \code{\LinkA{toString}{toString}} to convert the object
to character (if a vector or list, element by element) and then
right-justifies the result.

Justification for character vectors (and objects converted to
character vectors by their methods) is done on display width (see
\code{\LinkA{nchar}{nchar}}), taking double-width characters and the rendering
of special characters (as escape sequences, including escaping
backslash but not double quote: see \code{\LinkA{print.default}{print.default}}) into
account.  Thus the width is as displayed by \code{print(quote =
  FALSE)} and not as displayed by \code{\LinkA{cat}{cat}}.  Character strings
are padded with blanks to the display width of the widest.  (If
\code{na.encode = FALSE} missing character strings are not included in
the width computations and are not encoded.)

Numeric vectors are encoded with the minimum number of decimal places
needed to display all the elements to at least the \code{digits}
significant digits.  However, if all the elements then have trailing
zeroes, the number of decimal places is reduced until at least one
element has a non-zero final digit; see also the argument
documentation for \code{big.*}, \code{small.*} etc, above.  See the
note in \code{\LinkA{print.default}{print.default}} about \code{digits >= 16}.

Raw vectors are converted to their 2-digit hexadecimal representation
by \code{\LinkA{as.character}{as.character}}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
An object of similar structure to \code{x} containing character
representations of the elements of the first argument \code{x}
in a common format, and in the current locale's encoding.

For character, numeric, complex or factor \code{x}, dims and dimnames
are preserved on matrices/arrays and names on vectors: no other
attributes are copied.

If \code{x} is a list, the result is a character vector obtained by
applying \code{format.default(x, ...)} to each element of the list
(after \code{\LinkA{unlist}{unlist}}ing elements which are themselves lists),
and then collapsing the result for each element with
\code{paste(collapse = ", ")}.  The defaults in this case are
\code{trim = TRUE, justify = "none"} since one does not usually want
alignment in the collapsed strings.

\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] an atomic numerical or character object, possibly
\code{\LinkA{complex}{complex}} only for \code{prettyNum()}, typically a
vector of real numbers.

\item[\code{digits}] the desired number of digits after the decimal
point (\code{format = "f"}) or \emph{significant} digits
(\code{format = "g"}, \code{= "e"} or \code{= "fg"}).

Default: 2 for integer, 4 for real numbers.  If less than 0,
the C default of 6 digits is used.  If specified as more than 50, 50
will be used with a warning unless \code{format = "f"} where it is
limited to typically 324. (Not more than 15--21 digits need be
accurate, depending on the OS and compiler used.  This limit is
just a precaution against segfaults in the underlying C runtime.)


\item[\code{width}] the total field width; if both \code{digits} and
\code{width} are unspecified, \code{width} defaults to 1,
otherwise to \code{digits + 1}.  \code{width = 0} will use
\code{width = digits}, \code{width < 0} means left
justify the number in this field (equivalent to \code{flag ="-"}).
If necessary, the result will have more characters than
\code{width}.  For character data this is interpreted in characters
(not bytes nor display width).


\item[\code{format}] equal to \code{"d"}  (for integers), \code{"f"},
\code{"e"}, \code{"E"}, \code{"g"}, \code{"G"}, \code{"fg"} (for
reals), or \code{"s"} (for strings).  Default is \code{"d"} for
integers, \code{"g"} for reals.

\code{"f"} gives numbers in the usual
\code{xxx.xxx} format;  \code{"e"} and \code{"E"} give \code{n.ddde+nn} or
\code{n.dddE+nn} (scientific format); \code{"g"} and \code{"G"} put
\code{x[i]} into scientific format only if it saves space to do so.

\code{"fg"} uses fixed format as \code{"f"}, but \code{digits} as
the minimum number of \emph{significant} digits.  This can lead
to quite long result strings, see examples below.  Note that unlike
\code{\LinkA{signif}{signif}} this prints large numbers with
more significant digits than \code{digits}.  Trailing zeros are
\emph{dropped} in this format, unless \code{flag} contains
\code{"\#"}.

\item[\code{flag}] For \code{formatC}, a character string giving a
format modifier as in Kernighan and Ritchie (1988, page 243).
\code{"0"}  pads leading zeros; \code{"-"} does left adjustment,
others are \code{"+"}, \code{" "}, and \code{"\#"}.  There can be
more than one of these, in any order.


\item[\code{mode}] \code{"double"} (or \code{"real"}), \code{"integer"} or
\code{"character"}.
Default: Determined from the storage mode of \code{x}.

\item[\code{big.mark}] character; if not empty used as mark between every
\code{big.interval} decimals \emph{before} (hence \code{big}) the
decimal point.
\item[\code{big.interval}] see \code{big.mark} above; defaults to 3.
\item[\code{small.mark}] character; if not empty used as mark between every
\code{small.interval} decimals \emph{after} (hence \code{small}) the
decimal point.
\item[\code{small.interval}] see \code{small.mark} above; defaults to 5.
\item[\code{decimal.mark}] the character to be used to indicate the numeric
decimal point.
\item[\code{preserve.width}] string specifying if the string widths should
be preserved where possible in those cases where marks
(\code{big.mark} or \code{small.mark}) are added.  \code{"common"},
the default, corresponds to \code{\LinkA{format}{format}}-like behavior
whereas \code{"individual"} is the default in
\code{formatC()}.
\item[\code{zero.print}] logical, character string or \code{NULL} specifying
if and how \emph{zeros} should be formatted specially.  Useful for
pretty printing `sparse' objects.
\item[\code{drop0trailing}] logical, indicating if trailing zeros,
i.e., \code{"0"} \emph{after} the decimal mark, should be removed;
also drops \code{"e+00"} in exponential formats.
\item[\code{is.cmplx}] optional logical, to be used when \code{x} is
\code{"\LinkA{character}{character}"} to indicate if it stems from
\code{\LinkA{complex}{complex}} vector or not.  By default (\code{NA}),
\code{x} is checked to `look like' complex.
\item[\code{...}] arguments passed to \code{format}.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
If you set \code{format} it overrides the setting of \code{mode}, so
\code{formatC(123.45, mode="double", format="d")} gives \code{123}.

The rendering of scientific format is platform-dependent: some systems
use \code{n.ddde+nnn} or \code{n.dddenn} rather than \code{n.ddde+nn}.

\code{formatC} does not necessarily align the numbers on the decimal
point, so \code{formatC(c(6.11, 13.1), digits=2, format="fg")} gives
\code{c("6.1", " 13")}.  If you want common formatting for several
numbers, use \code{\LinkA{format}{format}}.

\code{prettyNum} is the utility function for prettifying \code{x}.
\code{x} can be complex (or \code{\LinkA{format}{format}(<complex>)}, here.  If
\code{x} is not a character, \code{format(x[i], ...)} is applied to
each element, and then it is left unchanged if all the other arguments
are at their defaults.  Note that \code{prettyNum(x)} may behave
unexpectedly if \code{x} is a \code{character} vector not resulting from
something like \code{format(<number>)}: in particular it assumes that
a period is a decimal mark.

Because \code{\LinkA{gsub}{gsub}} is used to insert the \code{big.mark}
and \code{small.mark}, special characters need escaping.  In particular, 
to insert a single backslash, use \code{"\bsl{}\bsl{}\bsl{}\bsl{}"}.  

In versions of \R{} before 2.13.0, the \code{big.mark} would be
reversed on insertion if it contained more than one character.  
\end{Details}

Unlike \code{\LinkA{format}{format}}, each number is formatted individually.

\code{Reduce} uses a binary function to successively combine the

\code{Filter} extracts the elements of a vector for which a predicate
(logical) function gives true.  \code{Find} and \code{Position} give
the first or last such element and its position in the vector,
respectively.  \code{Map} applies a function to the corresponding
elements of given vectors.  \code{Negate} creates the negation of a
given function.

\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{f}] a function of the appropriate arity (binary for
\code{Reduce}, unary for \code{Filter}, \code{Find} and
\code{Position}, \eqn{k}{}-ary for \code{Map} if this is called with
\eqn{k}{} arguments).  An arbitrary predicate function for
\code{Negate}.
\item[\code{x}] a vector.
\item[\code{init}] an \R{} object of the same kind as the elements of
\code{x}.
\item[\code{right}] a logical indicating whether to proceed from left to
right (default) or from right to left.
\item[\code{accumulate}] a logical indicating whether the successive reduce
combinations should be accumulated.  By default, only the final
combination is used.
\item[\code{nomatch}] the value to be returned in the case when
``no match'' (no element satisfying the predicate) is found.
\item[\code{...}] vectors.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
If \code{init} is given, \code{Reduce} logically adds it to the start
(when proceeding left to right) or the end of \code{x}, respectively.
If this possibly augmented vector \eqn{v}{} has \eqn{n > 1}{} elements,
\code{Reduce} successively applies \eqn{f}{} to the elements of \eqn{v}{}
from left to right or right to left, respectively.  I.e., a left
reduce computes \eqn{l_1 = f(v_1, v_2)}{}, \eqn{l_2 = f(l_1, v_3)}{}, etc.,
and returns \eqn{l_{n-1} = f(l_{n-2}, v_n)}{}, and a right reduce does
\eqn{r_{n-1} = f(v_{n-1}, v_n)}{}, \eqn{r_{n-2} = f(v_{n-2}, r_{n-1})}{}
and returns \eqn{r_1 = f(v_1, r_2)}{}.  (E.g., if \eqn{v}{} is the
sequence (2, 3, 4) and \eqn{f}{} is division, left and right reduce give
\eqn{(2 / 3) / 4 = 1/6}{} and \eqn{2 / (3 / 4) = 8/3}{}, respectively.)
If \eqn{v}{} has only a single element, this is returned; if there are
no elements, \code{NULL} is returned.  Thus, it is ensured that
\code{f} is always called with 2 arguments.

The current implementation is non-recursive to ensure stability and
scalability.

\code{Reduce} is patterned after Common Lisp's \code{reduce}.  A
reduce is also known as a fold (e.g., in Haskell) or an accumulate
(e.g., in the C++ Standard Template Library).  The accumulative
version corresponds to Haskell's scan functions.

\code{Filter} applies the unary predicate function \code{f} to each
element of \code{x}, coercing to logical if necessary, and returns the
subset of \code{x} for which this gives true.  Note that possible
\code{NA} values are currently always taken as false; control over
\code{NA} handling may be added in the future.  \code{Filter}
corresponds to \code{filter} in Haskell or \code{remove-if-not} in
Common Lisp.

\code{Find} and \code{Position} are patterned after Common Lisp's
\code{find-if} and \code{position-if}, respectively.  If there is an
element for which the predicate function gives true, then the first or
last such element or its position is returned depending on whether
\code{right} is false (default) or true, respectively.  If there is no
such element, the value specified by \code{nomatch} is returned.  The
current implementation is not optimized for performance.

\code{Map} is a simple wrapper to \code{\LinkA{mapply}{mapply}} which does not
attempt to simplify the result, similar to Common Lisp's \code{mapcar}
(with arguments being recycled, however).  Future versions may allow
some control of the result type.

\code{Negate} corresponds to Common Lisp's \code{complement}.  Given a
(predicate) function \code{f}, it creates a function which returns the
logical negation of what \code{f} returns.

add(list(1, 2, 3))
## Like sum(), but can also used for adding matrices etc., as it will
## use the appropriate '+' method in each reduction step.
## More generally, many generics meant to work on arbitrarily many
## arguments can be defined via reduction:
FOO <- function(...) Reduce(FOO2, list(...))
FOO2 <- function(x, y) UseMethod("FOO2")
## FOO() methods can then be provided via FOO2() methods.

## A general-purpose cumulative adder:
cadd <- function(x) Reduce("+", x, accumulate = TRUE)
cadd(seq_len(7))

## A simple function to compute continued fractions:
cfrac <- function(x) Reduce(function(u, v) u + 1 / v, x, right = TRUE)
## Continued fraction approximation for pi:
cfrac(c(3, 7, 15, 1, 292))
## Continued fraction approximation for Euler's number (e):
cfrac(c(2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8))

## Iterative function application:
Funcall <- function(f, ...) f(...)
## Compute log(exp(acos(cos(0))
Reduce(Funcall, list(log, exp, acos, cos), 0, right = TRUE)
## n-fold iterate of a function, functional style:
Iterate <- function(f, n = 1)
    function(x) Reduce(Funcall, rep.int(list(f), n), x, right = TRUE)
## Continued fraction approximation to the golden ratio:
Iterate(function(x) 1 + 1 / x, 30)(1)
## which is the same as
cfrac(rep.int(1, 31))
## Computing square root approximations for x as fixed points of the
## function t |-> (t + x / t) / 2, as a function of the initial value:
asqrt <- function(x, n) Iterate(function(t) (t + x / t) / 2, n)
asqrt(2, 30)(10) # Starting from a positive value => +sqrt(2)
asqrt(2, 30)(-1) # Starting from a negative value => -sqrt(2)

## A list of all functions in the base environment:
funs <- Filter(is.function, sapply(ls(baseenv()), get, baseenv()))
## Functions in base with more than 10 arguments:
names(Filter(function(f) length(formals(args(f))) > 10, funs))
## Number of functions in base with a '...' argument:
length(Filter(function(f)
              any(names(formals(args(f))) %in% "..."),
              funs))

## Find all objects in the base environment which are *not* functions:

\begin{Description}\relax
A call of \code{gc} causes a garbage collection to take place.
\code{gcinfo} sets a flag so that
automatic collection is either silent (\code{verbose=FALSE}) or
prints memory usage statistics (\code{verbose=TRUE}).
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
gc(verbose = getOption("verbose"), reset=FALSE)
gcinfo(verbose)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{verbose}] logical; if \code{TRUE}, the garbage collection prints
statistics about cons cells and the space allocated for vectors.
\item[\code{reset}] logical; if \code{TRUE} the values for maximum space used
are reset to the current values.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
A call of \code{gc} causes a garbage collection to take place.
This will also take place automatically without user intervention, and the
primary purpose of calling \code{gc} is for the report on memory usage.

However, it can be useful to call \code{gc} after a large object
has been removed, as this may prompt \R{} to return memory to the
operating system.

\R{} allocates space for vectors in multiples of 8 bytes: hence the
report of \code{"Vcells"}, a relict of an earlier allocator (that used
a vector heap).

When \code{gcinfo(TRUE)} is in force, messages are sent to the message
connection at each garbage collection of the form
\begin{alltt}    Garbage collection 12 = 10+0+2 (level 0) ...
    6.4 Mbytes of cons cells used (58%)
    2.0 Mbytes of vectors used (32%)
\end{alltt}

Here the last two lines give the current memory usage rounded up to
the next 0.1Mb and as a percentage of the current trigger value.
The first line gives a breakdown of the number of garbage collections
at various levels (for an explanation see the `R Internals' manual).
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{gc} returns a matrix with rows \code{"Ncells"} (\emph{cons
cells}), usually 28 bytes each on 32-bit systems and 56 bytes on
64-bit systems, and \code{"Vcells"} (\emph{vector cells}, 8 bytes
each), and columns \code{"used"} and \code{"gc trigger"},
each also interpreted in megabytes (rounded up to the next 0.1Mb).

If maxima have been set for either \code{"Ncells"} or \code{"Vcells"},
a fifth column is printed giving the current limits in Mb (with
\code{NA} denoting no limit).

The final two columns show the maximum space used since the last call
to \code{gc(reset=TRUE)} (or since \R{} started).

\code{gcinfo} returns the previous value of the flag.

Provokes garbage collection on (nearly) every memory allocation.

\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{on}] logical; turning it on/off.
\item[\code{step}] integer; run GC every \code{step} allocations; \code{step
      = 0} turns the GC torture off.
\item[\code{wait}] integer; number of allocations to wait before starting
GC torture.
\item[\code{inhibit\_release}] logical; do not release free objects for
re-use: use with caution.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
Calling \code{gctorture(TRUE)} instructs the memory manager to force a
full GC on every allocation. \code{gctorture2} provides a more refined
interface that allows the start of the GC torture to be deferred and
also gives the option of running a GC only every \code{step}
allocations.

The third argument to \code{gctorture2} is only used if R has been
configured with a strict write barrier enabled.  When this is
the case all garbage collections are full collections, and the memory
manager marks free nodes and enables checks in many situations that
signal an error when a free node is used.  This can greatly help in
isolating unprotected values in C code.  It does not detect the case
where a node becomes free and is reallocated.  The
\code{inhibit\_release} argument can be used to prevent such
reallocation.  This will cause memory to grow and should be used with
caution and in conjunction with operating system facilities to monitor
and limit process memory use.

     inherits = FALSE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] a variable name (given as a character string).
\item[\code{pos}] where to look for the object (see the details section); if
omitted, the function will search as if the name of the object
appeared unquoted in an expression.
\item[\code{envir}] an alternative way to specify an environment to look in;
see the `Details' section.
\item[\code{mode}] the mode or type of object sought: see the
`Details' section.
\item[\code{inherits}] should the enclosing frames of the environment be
searched?
\item[\code{ifnotfound}] A \code{\LinkA{list}{list}} of values to be used if the item is
not found: it will be coerced to list if necessary.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The \code{pos} argument can specify the environment in which to look
for the object in any of several ways: as an integer (the position in
the \code{\LinkA{search}{search}} list); as the character string name of an
element in the search list; or as an \code{\LinkA{environment}{environment}}
(including using \code{\LinkA{sys.frame}{sys.frame}} to access the currently active
function calls).  The \code{envir} argument is an alternative way to
specify an environment, but is primarily there for back compatibility.

This function looks to see if the name \code{x} has a value bound to
it in the specified environment.  If \code{inherits} is \code{TRUE} and
a value is not found for \code{x} in the specified environment, the
enclosing frames of the environment are searched until the name \code{x}
is encountered.  See \code{\LinkA{environment}{environment}} and the `R
Language Definition' manual for details about the structure of
environments and their enclosures.

\bold{Warning:}
\code{inherits = TRUE} is the default behaviour for \R{} but not for S.

If \code{mode} is specified then only objects of that type are sought.
The \code{mode} may specify one of the collections \code{"numeric"} and
\code{"function"} (see \code{\LinkA{mode}{mode}}): any member of the
collection will suffice.

Using a \code{NULL} environment is equivalent to using the current
environment.

For \code{mget} multiple values are returned in a named
\code{list}.   This is true even if only one value is requested. The
value in \code{mode} and \code{ifnotfound} can be either the same length
as the number of requested items or of length 1.  The argument
\code{ifnotfound} must be a list containing either the value to use if
the requested item is not found or a function of one argument which
will be called if the item is not found, with argument the name of
the item being requested.  The default value for \code{inherits} is
\code{FALSE}, in contrast to the default behavior for \code{get}.

\code{mode} here is a mixture of the meanings of \code{\LinkA{typeof}{typeof}}
and \code{\LinkA{mode}{mode}}:  \code{"function"} covers primitive functions
and operators, \code{"numeric"}, \code{"integer"}, \code{"real"}
and \code{"double"} all refer to any numeric type, \code{"symbol"} and
\code{"name"} are equivalent \emph{but} \code{"language"} must be used.

\begin{Description}\relax
This function allows us to query the set of routines
in a DLL that are registered with R to enhance
dynamic lookup, error handling when calling native routines,
and potentially security in the future.
This function provides a description of each of the
registered routines in the DLL for the different interfaces,
i.e. \code{\LinkA{.C}{.C}}, \code{\LinkA{.Call}{.Call}}, \code{\LinkA{.Fortran}{.Fortran}}
and \code{\LinkA{.External}{.External}}.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
getDLLRegisteredRoutines(dll, addNames = TRUE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{dll}] a character string or \code{DLLInfo} object.
The character string specifies the file name of the DLL
of interest, and is given without the file name extension (e.g., the
\file{.dll} or \file{.so}) and with no directory/path information.
So a file \file{MyPackage/libs/MyPackage.so} would be specified as
\samp{MyPackage}.

The \code{DLLInfo} objects can be obtained directly
in calls to \code{\LinkA{dyn.load}{dyn.load}} and  \code{\LinkA{library.dynam}{library.dynam}},
or can be found after the DLL has been loaded using
\code{\LinkA{getLoadedDLLs}{getLoadedDLLs}}, which returns a list of
\code{DLLInfo} objects (index-able by DLL file name).

The \code{DLLInfo} approach avoids any ambiguities related to two
DLLs having the same name but corresponding to files in different
directories.

\item[\code{addNames}] a logical value.  If this is \code{TRUE}, the elements
of the returned lists are named using the names of the routines (as
seen by R via registration or raw name).  If \code{FALSE},
these names are not computed and assigned to the lists.  As a
result, the call should be quicker.  The name information is also
available in the \code{NativeSymbolInfo} objects in the lists.

\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
This takes the registration information after it has been registered
and processed by the R internals.  In other words, it uses the extended
information.

There is \code{print} methods for the class, which prints only the
types which have registered routines.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
A list of class \code{"DLLRegisteredRoutines"} with four elements
corresponding to the routines registered for the \code{.C},
\code{.Call}, \code{.Fortran} and \code{.External} interfaces. Each is
a list with as many elements as there were routines registered for
that interface.

Each element identifies a routine and is an object
of class \code{"NativeSymbolInfo"}.
An object of this class has the following fields:
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{name}] the registered name of the routine (not necessarily the
name in the C code).
\item[\code{address}] the memory address of the routine as resolved in the
loaded DLL. This may be \code{NULL} if the symbol has not yet been
resolved.
\item[\code{dll}] an object of class \code{DLLInfo} describing the DLL.
This is same for all elements returned.
\item[\code{numParameters}] the number of arguments the native routine is to
be called with.  In the future, we will provide information about
the types of the parameters also.

\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{name}] the abbreviated name.
\item[\code{path}] the fully qualified name of the loaded DLL.
\item[\code{dynamicLookup}] a logical value indicating whether R uses only
the registration information to resolve symbols or whether it
searches the entire symbol table of the DLL.
\item[\code{handle}] a reference to the C-level data structure that
provides access to the contents of the DLL.
This is an object of class \code{"DLLHandle"}.

\end{ldescription}
Note that the class \code{DLLInfo} has an overloaded method for
\code{\$} which can be used to resolve native symbols within that
DLL.  Therefore, one must access the R-level elements described
above using \code{[[}, e.g. \code{x[["name"]]} or \code{x[["handle"]]}.

This finds and returns a description of one or more dynamically loaded

returns information about the name of the symbol, the library in which
it is located and, if available, the number of arguments it expects
and by which interface it should be called (i.e \code{\LinkA{.Call}{.Call}},
\code{\LinkA{.C}{.C}}, \code{\LinkA{.Fortran}{.Fortran}}, or
\code{\LinkA{.External}{.External}}). Additionally, it returns the address of the
symbol and this can be passed to other C routines.  Specifically, this
provides a way to explicitly share symbols between different
dynamically loaded package libraries.  Also, it provides a way to
query where symbols were resolved, and aids diagnosing strange
behavior associated with dynamic resolution.

\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{name}] the name(s) of the native symbol(s).

\item[\code{PACKAGE}] an optional argument that specifies to which
DLL to restrict the search for this symbol.  If this is
\code{"base"}, we search in the \R{} executable itself.

\item[\code{unlist}] a logical value which controls how the result is
returned if the function is called with the name of a single symbol.
If \code{unlist} is \code{TRUE} and the number of symbol names in
\code{name} is one, then the \code{NativeSymbolInfo} object
is returned.  If it is \code{FALSE}, then a list
of \code{NativeSymbolInfo} objects is returned.
This is ignored if the number of symbols passed in \code{name} is
more than one. 
To be compatible with earlier versions of this function, this
defaults to \code{TRUE}.

\item[\code{withRegistrationInfo}] a logical value indicating whether, if
\code{TRUE}, to return information that was registered with \R{} about
the symbol and its parameter types if such information is available,
or if \code{FALSE} to return just the address of the symbol.

\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
This uses the same mechanism for resolving symbols as is used
in all the native interfaces (\code{\LinkA{.Call}{.Call}}, etc.).
If the symbol has been explicitly registered by the DLL
in which it is contained, information about the number of arguments
and the interface by which it should be called will be returned.
Otherwise, a generic native symbol object is returned.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
Generally, a list of \code{NativeSymbolInfo} elements whose elements
can be indexed by the elements of \code{name}  in the call.  Each
\code{NativeSymbolInfo} object is a list containing the following
elements:
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{name}] the name of the symbol, as given by the
\code{name} argument.
\item[\code{address}] if \code{withRegistrationInfo} is \code{FALSE},
this is the native memory address of the symbol which can
be used to invoke the routine, and also to
compare with other symbol addresses.  This is an external pointer
object and of class \code{NativeSymbol}.
If \code{withRegistrationInfo} is \code{TRUE} and registration
information is available for the symbol, then this is
an object of class \code{RegisteredNativeSymbol} and is a reference
to an internal data type that has access to the routine pointer and
registration information.  This too can be used in calls to
\code{\LinkA{.Call}{.Call}}, \code{\LinkA{.C}{.C}}, \code{\LinkA{.Fortran}{.Fortran}} and
\code{\LinkA{.External}{.External}}.

\item[\code{package}] a list containing 3 elements:
\begin{description}

\item[name] the short form of the library name which can be used
as the value of the \code{PACKAGE} argument in
the different native interface functions.
\item[path] the fully qualified name of the DLL.
\item[dynamicLookup] a logical value indicating whether dynamic
resolution is used when looking for symbols in this library,
or only registered routines can be located.

\end{description}
    

\end{ldescription}
If the routine was explicitly registered by the dynamically loaded
library, the list contains a fourth field
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{numParameters}] the number of arguments that should be passed in
a call to this routine.
\end{ldescription}
Additionally, the list will have an additional class,
being \code{CRoutine}, \code{CallRoutine}, \code{FortranRoutine} or
\code{ExternalRoutine} corresponding to the R interface by which it
should be invoked.

If any of the symbols is not found, an error is raised.

If \code{name} contains only one symbol name and \code{unlist} is
\code{TRUE}, then the single \code{NativeSymbolInfo} is returned
rather than the list containing that one element.

able to pass native routines to C routines as function pointers in C.
This allows us to treat native routines and \R{} functions in a similar
manner, such as when passing an \R{} function to C code that makes
callbacks to that function at different points in its computation
(e.g., \code{\LinkA{nls}{nls}}).  Additionally, we can resolve the symbol
just once and avoid resolving it repeatedly or using the internal
cache.

\begin{Description}\relax
If Native Language Support was enabled in this build of \R{}, attempt to
translate character vectors or set where the translations are to be found.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
gettext(..., domain = NULL)

ngettext(n, msg1, msg2, domain = NULL)

bindtextdomain(domain, dirname = NULL)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{...}] One or more character vectors.
\item[\code{domain}] The `domain' for the translation.
\item[\code{n}] a non-negative integer.
\item[\code{msg1}] the message to be used in English for \code{n = 1}.
\item[\code{msg2}] the message to be used in English for \code{n = 0, 2, 3,...}.
\item[\code{dirname}] The directory in which to find translated message
catalogs for the domain.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
If \code{domain} is \code{NULL} or \code{""}, a domain is searched for
based on the namespace which contains the function calling
\code{gettext} or \code{ngettext}.  If a suitable domain can be found,
each character string is offered for translation, and replaced by its
translation into the current language if one is found.

Conventionally the domain for \R{} warning/error messages in package
\pkg{pkg} is \code{"R-pkg"}, and that for C-level messages is \code{"pkg"}.

For \code{gettext}, leading and trailing whitespace is ignored when
looking for the translation.

\code{ngettext} is used where the message needs to vary by a single
integer.  Translating such messages is subject to very specific rules
for different languages: see the GNU Gettext Manual.  The string
will often contain a single instance of \code{\%d} to be used in
\code{\LinkA{sprintf}{sprintf}}.  If English is used, \code{msg1} is returned if
\code{n == 1} and \code{msg2} in all other cases.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
For \code{gettext}, a character vector, one element per string in
\code{...}.  If translation is not enabled or no domain is found or
no translation is found in that domain, the original strings are
returned.

For \code{ngettext}, a character string.

For \code{bindtextdomain}, a character string giving the current base
directory, or \code{NULL} if setting it failed.
\end{Value}

\code{getwd} returns a character string or \code{NULL} if the working

Note that the return value is said to be \strong{an} absolute

\item[\code{pattern}] character string containing a \LinkA{regular expression}{regular expression}

\code{\LinkA{as.character}{as.character}} to a character string if possible.  If a
character vector of length 2 or more is supplied, the first element
is used with a warning.  Missing values are allowed except for
\code{regexpr} and \code{gregexpr}.
\item[\code{x, text}] a character vector where matches are sought, or an
object which can be coerced by \code{as.character} to a character vector.
\item[\code{ignore.case}] if \code{FALSE}, the pattern matching is \emph{case
sensitive} and if \code{TRUE}, case is ignored during matching.
\item[\code{perl}] logical.  Should perl-compatible regexps be used?
\item[\code{value}] if \code{FALSE}, a vector containing the (\code{integer})
indices of the matches determined by \code{grep} is returned, and if
\code{TRUE}, a vector containing the matching elements themselves is

\item[\code{fixed}] logical.  If \code{TRUE}, \code{pattern} is a string to be
matched as is.  Overrides all conflicting arguments.
\item[\code{useBytes}] logical.  If \code{TRUE} the matching is done
byte-by-byte rather than character-by-character.  See
`Details'.
\item[\code{invert}] logical.  If \code{TRUE} return indices or values for
elements that do \emph{not} match.
\item[\code{replacement}] a replacement for matched pattern in \code{sub} and
\code{gsub}.  Coerced to character if possible.  For \code{fixed =
      FALSE} this can include backreferences \code{"\bsl{}1"} to
\code{"\bsl{}9"} to parenthesized subexpressions of \code{pattern}.  For
\code{perl = TRUE} only, it can also contain \code{"\bsl{}U"} or
\code{"\bsl{}L"} to convert the rest of the replacement to upper or
lower case and \code{"\bsl{}E"} to end case conversion.  If a
character vector of length 2 or more is supplied, the first element
is used with a warning.  If \code{NA}, all elements in the result
corresponding to matches will be set to \code{NA}.

\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
Arguments which should be character strings or character vectors are
coerced to character if possible.

Each of these functions (apart from \code{regexec}, which currently
does not support Perl-style regular expressions) operates in one of
three modes:
\begin{enumerate}

\item \code{fixed = TRUE}: use exact matching.
\item \code{perl = TRUE}: use Perl-style regular expressions.
\item \code{fixed = FALSE, perl = FALSE}: use POSIX 1003.2
extended regular expressions.

\end{enumerate}

See the help pages on \LinkA{regular expression}{regular expression} for details of the
different types of regular expressions.

The two \code{*sub} functions differ only in that \code{sub} replaces
only the first occurrence of a \code{pattern} whereas \code{gsub}
replaces all occurrences.  If \code{replacement} contains
backreferences which are not defined in \code{pattern} the result is
undefined (but most often the backreference is taken to be \code{""}).

For \code{regexpr}, \code{gregexpr} and \code{regexec} it is an error
for \code{pattern} to be \code{NA}, otherwise \code{NA} is permitted
and gives an \code{NA} match.

The main effect of \code{useBytes} is to avoid errors/warnings about
invalid inputs and spurious matches in multibyte locales, but for
\code{regexpr} it changes the interpretation of the output.
It inhibits the conversion of inputs with marked encodings, and is
forced if any input is found which is marked as \code{"bytes"}.

Caseless matching does not make much sense for bytes in a multibyte
locale, and you should expect it only to work for ASCII characters if
\code{useBytes = TRUE}.

As from \R{} 2.14.0, \code{regexpr} and \code{gregexpr} with \code{perl
    = TRUE} allow Python-style named captures.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{grep(value = FALSE)} returns an integer vector of the indices
of the elements of \code{x} that yielded a match (or not, for
\code{invert = TRUE}.

\code{grep(value = TRUE)} returns a character vector containing the
selected elements of \code{x} (after coercion, preserving names but no
other attributes).

\code{grepl} returns a logical vector (match or not for each element of
\code{x}).

For \code{sub} and \code{gsub} return a character vector of the same
length and with the same attributes as \code{x} (after possible
coercion to character).  Elements of character vectors \code{x} which
are not substituted will be returned unchanged (including any declared
encoding).  If \code{useBytes = FALSE} a non-ASCII substituted result
will often be in UTF-8 with a marked encoding (e.g. if there is a
UTF-8 input, and in a multibyte locale unless \code{fixed = TRUE}).
Such strings can be re-encoded by \code{\LinkA{enc2native}{enc2native}}.

\code{regexpr} returns an integer vector of the same length as
\code{text} giving the starting position of the first match or
\eqn{-1}{} if there is none, with attribute \code{"match.length"}, an
integer vector giving the length of the matched text (or \eqn{-1}{} for
no match).  The match positions and lengths are in characters unless
\code{useBytes = TRUE} is used, when they are in bytes.  If named
capture is used there are further attributes \code{"capture.start"},
\code{"capture.length"} and \code{"capture.names"}.

\code{gregexpr} returns a list of the same length as \code{text} each
element of which is of the same form as the return value for
\code{regexpr}, except that the starting positions of every (disjoint)
match are given.

\code{regexec} returns a list of the same length as \code{text} each
element of which is either \eqn{-1}{} if there is no match, or a
sequence of integers with the starting positions of the match and all
substrings corresponding to parenthesized subexpressions of
\code{pattern}, with attribute \code{"match.length"} an integer vector
giving the lengths of the matches (or \eqn{-1}{} for no match).
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{Warning}
POSIX 1003.2 mode of \code{gsub} and \code{gregexpr} does not
work correctly with repeated word-boundaries (e.g. \code{pattern =
  "\bsl{}b"}).  Use \code{perl = TRUE} for such matches (but that may not
work as expected with non-ASCII inputs, as the meaning of
`word' is system-dependent).
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Performance considerations}
If you are doing a lot of regular expression matching, including on
very long strings, you will want to consider the options used.
Generally PCRE will be faster than the default regular expression
engine, and \code{fixed = TRUE} faster still (especially when each
pattern is matched only a few times).

If you are working in a single-byte locale and have marked UTF-8
strings that are representable in that locale, convert them first as
just one UTF-8 string will force all the matching to be done in
Unicode, which attracts a penalty of around \eqn{3\times{}}{} for
the default POSIX 1003.2 mode.

If you can make use of \code{useBytes = TRUE}, the strings will not be
checked before matching, and the actual matching will be faster.
Often byte-based matching suffices in a UTF-8 locale since byte
patterns of one character never match part of another.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
Prior to \R{} 2.11.0 there was an argument \code{extended} which could
be used to select `basic' regular expressions: this was often
used when \code{fixed = TRUE} would be preferable.  In the actual
implementation (as distinct from the POSIX standard) the only
difference was that \samp{?}, \samp{+}, \samp{\{}, \samp{|}, \samp{(},
and \samp{)} were not interpreted as metacharacters.
\end{Note}
%
\begin{Source}\relax
The C code for POSIX-style regular expression matching has changed
over the years.  As from \R{} 2.10.0 the TRE library of Ville Laurikari
(\url{http://laurikari.net/tre/}) is used.  From 2005 to \R{} 2.9.2,
code based on \code{glibc} was used (and before that, code from GNU
\command{grep}).  The POSIX standard does give some room for
interpretation, especially in the handling of invalid regular
expressions and the collation of character ranges, so the results will
have changed slightly.

For Perl-style matching PCRE (\url{http://www.pcre.org}) is used.

\item[\code{ignore.case}] if \code{FALSE}, the pattern matching is \emph{case
sensitive} and if \code{TRUE}, case is ignored during matching.
\item[\code{offset}] An integer specifying the offset from
which the search should start.  Must be positive.  The beginning of
line is defined to be at that offset so \code{"\textasciicircum{}"} will match there.
\item[\code{value}] logical.  Determines the return value: see `Value'.
\item[\code{fixed}] logical.  If \code{TRUE}, \code{pattern} is a pattern to be
matched as is.
\item[\code{all}] logical.  If \code{TRUE} all matches are returned,
otherwise just the first one.
\item[\code{invert}] logical.  If \code{TRUE} return indices or values for
elements that do \emph{not} match.  Ignored (with a warning) unless
\code{value = TRUE}.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
Unlike \code{\LinkA{grep}{grep}}, seeks matching patterns within the raw
vector \code{x} . This has implications especially in the \code{all =
  TRUE} case, e.g., patterns matching empty strings are inherently
infinite and thus may lead to unexpected results.

The argument \code{invert} is interpreted as asking to return the
complement of the match, which is only meaningful for \code{value =
  TRUE}.  Argument \code{offset} determines the start of the search, not
of the complement.  Note that \code{invert = TRUE} with \code{all =
  TRUE} will split \code{x} into pieces delimited by the pattern
including leading and trailing empty strings (consequently the use of
regular expressions with \code{"\textasciicircum{}"} or \code{"\$"} in that case may
lead to less intuitive results).

Some combinations of arguments such as \code{fixed = TRUE} with
\code{value = TRUE} are supported but are less meaningful.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{grepRaw(value = FALSE)} returns an integer vector of the offsets
at which matches have occurred.  If \code{all = FALSE} then it will be
either of length zero (no match) or length one (first matching
position).

\code{grepRaw(value = TRUE, all = FALSE)} returns a raw vector which
is either empty (no match) or the matched part of \code{x}.

\code{grepRaw(value = TRUE, all = TRUE)} returns a (potentially
empty) list of raw vectors corresponding to the matched parts.

\begin{Description}\relax
Group generic methods can be defined for four pre-specified groups of
functions, \code{Math}, \code{Ops}, \code{Summary} and \code{Complex}.
(There are no objects of these names in base \R{}, but there are in the
\pkg{methods} package.)

A method defined for an individual member of the group takes
precedence over a method defined for the group as a whole.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
## S3 methods for group generics have prototypes:
Math(x, ...)
Ops(e1, e2)
Complex(z)
Summary(..., na.rm = FALSE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x, z, e1, e2}] objects.
\item[\code{...}] further arguments passed to methods.
\item[\code{na.rm}] logical: should missing values be removed?
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax


There are four \emph{groups} for which S3 methods can be written,
namely the \code{"Math"}, \code{"Ops"}, \code{"Summary"} and
\code{"Complex"} groups.  These are not \R{} objects in base \R{}, but
methods can be supplied for them and base \R{} contains
\code{\LinkA{factor}{factor}}, \code{\LinkA{data.frame}{data.frame}} and
\code{\LinkA{difftime}{difftime}} methods for the first three groups.  (There is
also a \code{\LinkA{ordered}{ordered}} method for \code{Ops},
\code{\LinkA{POSIXt}{POSIXt}} and \code{\LinkA{Date}{Date}} methods for \code{Math}
and \code{Ops}, \code{\LinkA{package\_version}{package.Rul.version}} methods for \code{Ops}
and \code{Summary}, as well as a \code{\LinkA{ts}{ts}} method for
\code{Ops} in package \pkg{stats}.)

\begin{enumerate}

\item Group \code{"Math"}:
\begin{itemize}

\item 
\code{abs}, \code{sign}, \code{sqrt},\\{}
\code{floor}, \code{ceiling}, \code{trunc},\\{}
\code{round}, \code{signif}

\item 
\code{exp}, \code{log},  \code{expm1}, \code{log1p},\\{}
\code{cos}, \code{sin}, \code{tan},\\{}
\code{acos}, \code{asin}, \code{atan}

\code{cosh}, \code{sinh}, \code{tanh},\\{}
\code{acosh}, \code{asinh}, \code{atanh}

\item 
\code{lgamma}, \code{gamma}, \code{digamma}, \code{trigamma}









\item \code{cumsum}, \code{cumprod}, \code{cummax}, \code{cummin}


\end{itemize}

Members of this group dispatch on \code{x}.  Most members accept
only one argument, but members \code{log}, \code{round} and
\code{signif} accept one or two arguments, and \code{trunc} accepts
one or more.

\item Group \code{"Ops"}:
\begin{itemize}

\item 
\code{"+"}, \code{"-"}, \code{"*"}, \code{"/"},
\code{"\textasciicircum{}"}, \code{"\%\%"}, \code{"\%/\%"}


\item \code{"\&"}, \code{"|"}, \code{"!"}


\item \code{"=="}, \code{"!="},
\code{"<"}, \code{"<="}, \code{">="}, \code{">"}


\end{itemize}

This group contains both binary and unary operators (\code{+},
\code{-} and \code{!}): when a unary operator is encountered the
\code{Ops} method is called with one argument and \code{e2} is
missing.

The classes of both arguments are considered in dispatching any
member of this group.  For each argument its vector of classes is
examined to see if there is a matching specific (preferred) or
\code{Ops} method.  If a method is found for just one argument or
the same method is found for both, it is used.
If different methods are found, there is a warning about
`incompatible methods': in that case or if no method is found
for either argument the internal method is used.

If the members of this group are called as functions, any argument
names are removed to ensure that positional matching is always used.

\item Group \code{"Summary"}:
\begin{itemize}

\item \code{all}, \code{any}

\item \code{sum}, \code{prod}

\item \code{min}, \code{max}

\item \code{range}

\end{itemize}

Members of this group dispatch on the first argument supplied.

\item Group \code{"Complex"}:
\begin{itemize}

\item \code{Arg}, \code{Conj}, \code{Im}, \code{Mod}, \code{Re}


\end{itemize}

Members of this group dispatch on \code{z}.

\end{enumerate}


Note that a method will be used for one of these groups or one of its
members \emph{only} if it corresponds to a \code{"class"} attribute,
as the internal code dispatches on \code{\LinkA{oldClass}{oldClass}} and not on
\code{\LinkA{class}{class}}.  This is for efficiency: having to dispatch on,
say, \code{Ops.integer} would be too slow.

The number of arguments supplied for primitive members of the
\code{"Math"} group generic methods is not checked prior to dispatch.

There is no lazy evaluation of arguments for group-generic functions.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Section}{Technical Details}
These functions are all primitive and \LinkA{internal generic}{internal generic}.

The details of method dispatch and variables such as \code{.Generic}
are discussed in the help for \code{\LinkA{UseMethod}{UseMethod}}.  There are a
few small differences:
\begin{itemize}

\item For the operators of group \code{Ops}, the object
\code{.Method} is a length-two character vector with elements the
methods selected for the left and right arguments respectively.  (If
no method was selected, the corresponding element is \code{""}.)
\item Object \code{.Group} records the group used for dispatch (if
a specific method is used this is \code{""}).

\end{itemize}

\end{Section}

\begin{Note}\relax
Package \pkg{methods} does contain objects with these names, which it
has re-used in confusing similar (but different) ways.  See the help
for that package.

%
\begin{Description}\relax
\code{gzcon} provides a modified connection that wraps an existing
connection, and decompresses reads or compresses writes through that
connection.  Standard \code{gzip} headers are assumed.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
gzcon(con, level = 6, allowNonCompressed = TRUE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{con}] a connection.
\item[\code{level}] integer between 0 and 9, the compression level when writing.
\item[\code{allowNonCompressed}] logical.  When reading, should
non-compressed input be allowed?
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
If \code{con} is open then the modified connection is opened.  Closing
the wrapper connection will also close the underlying connection.

Reading from a connection which does not supply a \code{gzip} magic
header is equivalent to reading from the original connection if
\code{allowNonCompressed} is true, otherwise an error.

Compressed output will contain embedded NUL bytes, and so \code{con}
is not permitted to be a \code{\LinkA{textConnection}{textConnection}} opened with
\code{open="w"}.  Use a writable \code{\LinkA{rawConnection}{rawConnection}} to
compress data into a variable.

The original connection becomes unusable: any object pointing to it will
now refer to the modified connection.  For this reason, the new
connection needs to be closed explicitly.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
An object inheriting from class \code{"connection"}.  This is the same
connection \emph{number} as supplied, but with a modified internal
structure.  It has binary mode.

\item[\code{x}] An object, for the methods inheriting from class \code{"hexmode"}.
\item[\code{width}] \code{NULL} or a positive integer specifying the minimum
field width to be used, with padding by leading zeroes.

%
\begin{Details}\relax
Class \code{"hexmode"} consists of integer vectors with that class
attribute, used merely to ensure that they are printed in hex.

If \code{width = NULL} (the default), the output is padded with
leading zeroes to the smallest width needed for all the non-missing
elements.

\code{as.hexmode} can convert integers (of \LinkA{type}{type} \code{"integer"} or
\code{"double"}) and character vectors whose elements contain only
\code{0-9}, \code{a-f}, \code{A-F} (or are \code{NA}) to class
\code{"hexmode"}.

There is a \code{\LinkA{!}{!}} method and \code{\LinkA{|}{|}}, \code{\LinkA{\&}{.Ramp.}} and
\code{\LinkA{xor}{xor}} methods: these recycle their arguments to the
length of the longer and then apply the operators bitwise to each
element.

than a character vector?
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The names of encodings and which ones are available are
platform-dependent.  All \R{} platforms support \code{""} (for the
encoding of the current locale), \code{"latin1"} and \code{"UTF-8"}.
Generally case is ignored when specifying an encoding.

On many platforms, including Windows, \code{iconvlist} provides an
alphabetical list of the supported encodings.  On others, the
information is on the man page for \code{iconv(5)} or elsewhere in the
man pages (but beware that the system command \code{iconv} may not
support the same set of encodings as the C functions \R{} calls).
Unfortunately, the names are rarely valid across all platforms.

Elements of \code{x} which cannot be converted (perhaps because they
are invalid or because they cannot be represented in the target
encoding) will be returned as \code{NA} unless \code{sub} is specified.

Most versions of \code{iconv} will allow transliteration by appending
\samp{//TRANSLIT} to the \code{to} encoding: see the examples.

Encoding \code{"ASCII"} is also accepted, and on most systems
\code{"C"} and \code{"POSIX"} are synonyms for ASCII.

Any encoding bits (see \code{\LinkA{Encoding}{Encoding}}) on elements of \code{x}
are ignored: they will always be translated as if from \code{from}
even if declared otherwise.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
If \code{toRaw = FALSE} (the default), the value is a character vector
of the same length and the same attributes as \code{x} (after
conversion to a character vector).

If \code{mark = TRUE} (the default) the elements of the result have a
declared encoding if \code{from} is \code{"latin1"} or \code{"UTF-8"},
or if \code{from = ""} and the current locale's encoding is detected
as Latin-1 or UTF-8.

If \code{toRaw = TRUE}, the value is a vector of the same length and
the same attributes as \code{x} whose elements are either \code{NULL}
(if conversion fails) or a raw vector.

For \code{iconvlist()}, a character vector (typically of a few hundred
elements).
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{Implementation Details}
There are three main implementations of \code{iconv} in use.
\samp{glibc} (as used on Linux) contains one.  Several platforms
supply GNU \samp{libiconv}, including Mac OS X, FreeBSD and Cygwin.
On Windows we use a version of Yukihiro Nakadaira's \samp{win\_iconv},
which is based on Windows' codepages.  All three have
\code{iconvlist}, ignore case in encoding names and support
\samp{//TRANSLIT} (but with different results, and for
\samp{win\_iconv} currently a `best fit' strategy is used except
for \code{to = "ASCII"}).

Most commercial Unixes contain an implemetation of \code{iconv} but
none we have encountered have supported the encoding names we need:
the ``R Installation and Administration Manual'' recommends
installing GNU \samp{libiconv} on Solaris and AIX, for example.

There are other implementations, e.g. NetBSD uses one from the Citrus
project (which does not support \samp{//TRANSLIT}) and there is an
older FreeBSD port (\samp{libiconv} is usually used there): it has not
been reported whether or not these work with \R{}.

Note that you cannot rely on invalid inputs being detected, especially
for \code{to = "ASCII"} where some implementations allow 8-bit
characters and pass them through unchanged or with transliteration.

\code{"default"}, asking for upper- or lower-case characters to be
sorted first.  The default is usually lower-case first, but not in
all languages (see the Danish example).
\item[\code{alternate\_handling}:] Controls the handling of
`variable' characters (mainly punctuation and symbols).
Possible values are \code{"non\_ignorable"} (primary strength) and
\code{"shifted"} (quaternary strength).
\item[\code{strength}:] Which components should be used?  Possible
values \code{"primary"}, \code{"secondary"}, \code{"tertiary"}
(default), \code{"quaternary"} and \code{"identical"}. 
\item[\code{french\_collation}:] In a French locale the way accents
affect collation is from right to left, whereas in most other locales
it is from left to right.  Possible values \code{"on"}, \code{"off"}
and \code{"default"}.
\item[\code{normalization}:] Should strings be normalized?  Possible values
are \code{"on"} and \code{"off"} (default).  This affects the
collation of composite characters.
\item[\code{case\_level}:] An additional level between secondary and
tertiary, used to distinguish large and small Japanese Kana
characters. Possible values \code{"on"} and \code{"off"} (default).
\item[\code{hiragana\_quaternary}:] Possible values \code{"on"} (sort
Hiragana first at quaternary level) and \code{"off"}.

\end{description}

Only the first three are likely to be of interest except to those with a 
detailed understanding of collation and specialized requirements.

Some examples are \code{case\_level="on", strength="primary"} to ignore
accent differences and \code{alternate\_handling="shifted"} to ignore
space and punctuation characters.

Note that these settings have no effect if collation is set to the
\code{C} locale, unless \code{locale} is specified.

\code{\LinkA{slot}{slot}}s of S4 objects.  It may well be too strict to set
\code{attrib.as.set = FALSE}.
\item[\code{ignore.bytecode}] logical indicating if byte code should be
ignored when comparing \LinkA{closure}{closure}s.

%
\begin{Details}\relax
A call to \code{identical} is the way to test exact equality in
\code{if} and \code{while} statements, as well as in logical
expressions that use \code{\&\&} or \code{||}.  In all these
applications you need to be assured of getting a single logical
value.

Users often use the comparison operators, such as \code{==} or
\code{!=}, in these situations.  It looks natural, but it is not what
these operators are designed to do in R.  They return an object like
the arguments.  If you expected \code{x} and \code{y} to be of length
1, but it happened that one of them wasn't, you will \emph{not} get a
single \code{FALSE}.  Similarly, if one of the arguments is \code{NA},
the result is also \code{NA}.  In either case, the expression
\code{if(x == y)....} won't work as expected.

The function \code{all.equal} is also sometimes used to test equality
this way, but was intended for something different:  it allows for
small differences in numeric results.

The computations in \code{identical} are also reliable and usually
fast.  There should never be an error.  The only known way to kill
\code{identical} is by having an invalid pointer at the C level,
generating a memory fault.  It will usually find inequality quickly.
Checking equality for two large, complicated objects can take longer
if the objects are identical or nearly so, but represent completely
independent copies.  For most applications, however, the computational cost
should be negligible.

If \code{single.NA} is true, as by default, \code{identical} sees
\code{\LinkA{NaN}{NaN}} as different from \code{\LinkA{NA\_real\_}{NA.Rul.real.Rul.}}, but all
\code{NaN}s are equal (and all \code{NA} of the same type are equal).

Character strings are regarded as identical if they are in different
marked encodings but would agree when translated to UTF-8.

If \code{attrib.as.set} is true, as by default, comparison of
attributes view them as a set (and not a vector, so order is not
tested).

If \code{ignore.bytecode} is true (the default), the compiled
bytecode of a function (see \code{\LinkA{cmpfun}{cmpfun}}) will be ignored in
the comparison. If it is false, functions will compare equal only if
they are copies of the same compiled object (or both are
uncompiled).  To check whether two different compiles are equal, you
should compare the results of \code{\LinkA{disassemble}{disassemble}()}.

Note that \code{identical(x,y,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE)} pickily tests for
very exact equality.

\begin{Details}\relax
Integer vectors exist so that data can be passed to C or Fortran code
which expects them, and so that (small) integer data can be represented
exactly and compactly.

Note that current implementations of \R{} use 32-bit integers for
integer vectors, so the range of representable integers is restricted
to about \eqn{\pm 2 \times 10^9}{}: \code{\LinkA{double}{double}}s can
hold much larger integers exactly.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{integer} creates a integer vector of the specified length.
Each element of the vector is equal to \code{0}.

\code{as.integer} attempts to coerce its argument to be of integer
type.  The answer will be \code{NA} unless the coercion succeeds.  Real
values larger in modulus than the largest integer are coerced to
\code{NA} (unlike S which gives the most extreme integer of the same
sign).  Non-integral numeric values are truncated towards zero (i.e.,
\code{as.integer(x)} equals \code{\LinkA{trunc}{trunc}(x)} there), and
imaginary parts of complex numbers are discarded (with a warning).
Character strings containing optional whitespace followed by either a
decimal representation or a hexadecimal representation (starting with
\code{0x} or \code{0X}) can be converted, as well as any allowed by
the platform for real numbers.  Like \code{\LinkA{as.vector}{as.vector}} it strips
attributes including names.  (To ensure that an object \code{x} is of
integer type without stripping attributes, use
\code{\LinkA{storage.mode}{storage.mode}(x) <- "integer"}.)

\code{is.integer} returns \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} depending on
whether its argument is of integer \LinkA{type}{type} or not, unless it is a
factor when it returns \code{FALSE}.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
\code{is.integer(x)} does \bold{not} test if \code{x} contains integer
numbers!  For that, use \code{\LinkA{round}{round}}, as in the function

interactive()
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
An interactive \R{} session is one in which it is assumed that there is
a human operator to interact with, so for example \R{} can prompt for
corrections to incorrect input or ask what to do next or if it is OK
to move to the next plot.

GUI consoles will arrange to start \R{} in an interactive session.  When
\R{} is run in a terminal (via \command{Rterm.exe} on Windows), it
assumes that it is interactive if \file{stdin} is connected to a
(pseudo-)terminal and not if \file{stdin} is redirected to a file or
pipe.  Command-line options \option{--interactive} (Unix) and
\option{--ess} (Windows, \command{Rterm.exe}) override the default
assumption.

Embedded uses of \R{} can set a session to be interactive or not.

Internally, whether a session is interactive determines
\begin{itemize}

\item how some errors are handled and reported, e.g. see
\code{\LinkA{stop}{stop}} and \code{\LinkA{options}{options}("showWarnCalls")}.

\item  whether one of \option{--save}, \option{--no-save} or
\option{--vanilla} is required, and if \R{} ever asks whether to save the
workspace.

\item the choice of default graphics device launched when needed and
by \code{\LinkA{dev.new}{dev.new}}: see \code{\LinkA{options}{options}("device")}

\item whether graphics devices ever ask for confirmation of a new
page.

\end{itemize}

In addition, \R{}'s own \R{} code makes use of \code{interactive()}: for

\begin{Description}\relax
\code{is.finite} and \code{is.infinite} return a vector of the same
length as \code{x}, indicating which elements are finite (not infinite
and not missing) or infinite.

\code{Inf} and \code{-Inf} are positive and negative infinity
whereas \code{NaN} means `Not a Number'.  (These apply to numeric
values and real and imaginary parts of complex values but not to
values of integer vectors.)  \code{Inf} and \code{NaN} are
\LinkA{reserved}{reserved} words in the \R{} language.
\end{Description}

\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
is.finite(x)
is.infinite(x)

is.nan(x)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] \R{} object to be tested: the default methods handle atomic
vectors.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{is.finite} returns a vector of the same length as \code{x} the
jth element of which is \code{TRUE} if \code{x[j]} is finite (i.e., it
is not one of the values \code{NA}, \code{NaN}, \code{Inf} or
\code{-Inf}) and \code{FALSE} otherwise.  Complex
numbers are finite if both the real and imaginary parts are.

\code{is.infinite} returns a vector of the same length as \code{x} the
jth element of which is \code{TRUE} if \code{x[j]} is infinite (i.e.,
equal to one of \code{Inf} or \code{-Inf}) and \code{FALSE}
otherwise.  This will be false unless \code{x} is numeric or complex.
Complex numbers are infinite if either the real or the imaginary part is.

\code{is.nan} tests if a numeric value is \code{NaN}.  Do not test
equality to \code{NaN}, or even use \code{\LinkA{identical}{identical}}, since
systems typically have many different NaN values.  One of these is
used for the numeric missing value \code{NA}, and \code{is.nan} is
false for that value.  A complex number is regarded as \code{NaN} if
either the real or imaginary part is \code{NaN} but not \code{NA}.
All elements of logical, integer and raw vectors are considered not to
be NaN.

All three functions accept \code{NULL} as input and return a length
zero result. The default methods accept character and raw vectors, and
return \code{FALSE} for all entries. Prior to \R{} version 2.14.0 they
accepted all input, returning \code{FALSE} for most non-numeric
values; cases which are not atomic vectors are now signalled as
errors.

All three functions are generic: you can write methods to handle
specific classes of objects, see \LinkA{InternalMethods}{InternalMethods}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
A logical vector of the same length as \code{x}: \code{dim},
\code{dimnames} and \code{names} attributes are preserved.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
In \R{}, basically all mathematical functions (including basic
\code{\LinkA{Arithmetic}{Arithmetic}}), are supposed to work properly with
\code{+/- Inf} and \code{NaN} as input or output.

The basic rule should be that calls and relations with \code{Inf}s
really are statements with a proper mathematical \emph{limit}.

Computations involving \code{NaN} will return \code{NaN} or perhaps
\code{\LinkA{NA}{NA}}: which of those two is not guaranteed and may depend
on the \R{} platform (since compilers may re-order computations).

condition number of a matrix or of the \eqn{R}{} matrix of a \eqn{QR}{}
decomposition, perhaps of a linear fit.  The 2-norm condition number
can be shown to be the ratio of the largest to the smallest
\emph{non-zero} singular value of the matrix.

\code{rcond()} computes an approximation of the \bold{r}eciprocal
\bold{cond}ition number, see the details.

\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
kappa(z, ...)
## Default S3 method:
kappa(z, exact = FALSE,
      norm = NULL, method = c("qr", "direct"), ...)
## S3 method for class 'lm'

\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{z,x}] A matrix or a the result of \code{\LinkA{qr}{qr}} or a fit from
a class inheriting from \code{"lm"}.
\item[\code{exact}] logical.  Should the result be exact?
\item[\code{norm}] character string, specifying the matrix norm with respect
to which the condition number is to be computed, see also
\code{\LinkA{norm}{norm}}.  For \code{rcond}, the default is \code{"O"},
meaning the \bold{O}ne- or 1-norm.  The (currently only) other
possible value is \code{"I"} for the infinity norm.
\item[\code{method}] character string, specifying the method to be used;
\code{"qr"} is default for back-compatibility, mainly.
\item[\code{triangular}] logical.  If true, the matrix used is just the lower
triangular part of \code{z}.
\item[\code{LINPACK}] logical.  If true and \code{z} is not complex, the
Linpack routine \code{dtrco()} is called; otherwise the relevant
Lapack routine is.
\item[\code{...}] further arguments passed to or from other methods;
for \code{kappa.*()}, notably \code{LINPACK} when \code{norm} is not
\code{"2"}.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
For \code{kappa()}, if \code{exact = FALSE} (the default) the 2-norm
condition number is estimated by a cheap approximation.  However, the
exact calculation (via \code{\LinkA{svd}{svd}}) is also likely to be quick
enough.

Note that the 1- and Inf-norm condition numbers are much faster to
calculate, and \code{rcond()} computes these \emph{\bold{r}eciprocal}
condition numbers, also for complex matrices, using standard Lapack
routines.

\code{kappa} and \code{rcond} are different interfaces to
\emph{partly} identical functionality.

\code{.kappa\_tri} is an internal function called by \code{kappa.qr} and
\code{kappa.default}.

%
\begin{Description}\relax
\code{lapply} returns a list of the same length as \code{X}, each
element of which is the result of applying \code{FUN} to the
corresponding element of \code{X}.

\code{sapply} is a user-friendly version and wrapper of \code{lapply}
by default returning a vector, matrix or, if \code{simplify="array"}, an
array if appropriate, by applying \code{simplify2array()}.
\code{sapply(x, f, simplify=FALSE, USE.NAMES=FALSE)} is the same as
\code{lapply(x,f)}.

\code{vapply} is similar to \code{sapply}, but has a pre-specified
type of return value, so it can be safer (and sometimes faster) to
use.

\code{replicate} is a wrapper for the common use of \code{sapply} for
repeated evaluation of an expression (which will usually involve
random number generation).

\code{simplify2array()} is the utility called from \code{sapply()}
when \code{simplify} is not false and is similarly called from
\code{\LinkA{mapply}{mapply}()}.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
lapply(X, FUN, ...)

sapply(X, FUN, ..., simplify = TRUE, USE.NAMES = TRUE)

vapply(X, FUN, FUN.VALUE, ..., USE.NAMES = TRUE)

replicate(n, expr, simplify = "array")

simplify2array(x, higher=TRUE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{X}] a vector (atomic or list) or an \code{\LinkA{expression}{expression}}
object.  Other objects (including classed objects) will be coerced
by \code{base::\LinkA{as.list}{as.list}}.
\item[\code{FUN}] the function to be applied to each element of \code{X}:
see `Details'.  In the case of functions like
\code{+}, \code{\%*\%}, the function name must be backquoted or quoted.
\item[\code{...}] optional arguments to \code{FUN}.
\item[\code{simplify}] logical or character string; should the result be
simplified to a vector, matrix or higher dimensional array if
possible?  For \code{sapply} it must be named and not abbreviated. 
The default value, \code{TRUE}, returns a vector or matrix if appropriate,
whereas if \code{simplify = "array"} the result may be an
\code{\LinkA{array}{array}} of ``rank''
(\eqn{=}{}\code{length(dim(.))}) one higher than the result
of \code{FUN(X[[i]])}.
\item[\code{USE.NAMES}] logical; if \code{TRUE} and if \code{X} is character,
use \code{X} as \code{\LinkA{names}{names}} for the result unless it had names
already.  Since this argument follows \code{...} its name cannot
be abbreviated.
\item[\code{FUN.VALUE}] a (generalized) vector; a template for the return
value from FUN.  See `Details'.
\item[\code{n}] integer: the number of replications.
\item[\code{expr}] the expression (language object, usually a call)
to evaluate repeatedly.

\item[\code{x}] a list, typically returned from \code{lapply()}.
\item[\code{higher}] logical; if true, \code{simplify2array()} will produce a
(``higher rank'') array when appropriate, whereas
\code{higher = FALSE} would return a matrix (or vector) only.
These two cases correspond to \code{sapply(*, simplify = "array")} or
\code{simplify = TRUE}, respectively.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{FUN} is found by a call to \code{\LinkA{match.fun}{match.fun}} and typically
is specified as a function or a symbol (e.g. a backquoted name) or a
character string specifying a function to be searched for from the
environment of the call to \code{lapply}.

Function \code{FUN} must be able to accept as input any of the
elements of \code{X}.  If the latter is an atomic vector, \code{FUN}
will always be passed a length-one vector of the same type as \code{X}.

Arguments in \code{...} cannot have the same name as any of the
other arguments, and care may be needed to avoid partial matching to
\code{FUN}.  In general-purpose code it is good practice to name the
first two arguments \code{X} and \code{FUN} if \code{...} is passed
through: this both avoids partial matching to \code{FUN} and ensures
that a sensible error message is given if arguments named \code{X} or
\code{FUN} are passed through \code{...}.

Simplification in \code{sapply} is only attempted if \code{X} has
length greater than zero and if the return values from all elements
of \code{X} are all of the same (positive) length.  If the common
length is one the result is a vector, and if greater than one is a
matrix with a column corresponding to each element of \code{X}.

Simplification is always done in \code{vapply}.  This function
checks that all values of \code{FUN} are compatible with the
\code{FUN.VALUE}, in that they must have the same length and type.
(Types may be promoted to a higher type within the ordering logical
< integer < real < complex, but not demoted.)

Users of S4 classes should pass a list to \code{lapply} and
\code{vapply}: the internal coercion is done by the \code{as.list} in
the base namespace and not one defined by a user (e.g. by setting S4
methods on the base function).


\code{lapply} and \code{vapply} are \LinkA{primitive}{primitive} functions.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
For \code{lapply}, \code{sapply(simplify = FALSE)} and
\code{replicate(simplify = FALSE)}, a list.

For \code{sapply(simplify = TRUE)} and \code{replicate(simplify =
  TRUE)}: if \code{X} has length zero or \code{n = 0}, an empty list.
Otherwise an atomic vector or matrix or list of the same length as
\code{X} (of length \code{n} for \code{replicate}).  If simplification
occurs, the output type is determined from the highest type of the
return values in the hierarchy NULL < raw < logical < integer < real <
complex < character < list < expression, after coercion of pairlists
to lists.

\code{vapply} returns a vector or array of type matching the
\code{FUN.VALUE}.  If \code{length(FUN.VALUE) == 1} a
vector of the same length as \code{X} is returned, otherwise
an array.  If \code{FUN.VALUE} is not an \code{\LinkA{array}{array}}, the
result is a matrix   with \code{length(FUN.VALUE)} rows and
\code{length(X)} columns, otherwise an array \code{a} with
\code{\LinkA{dim}{dim}(a) == c(dim(FUN.VALUE), length(X))}.

The (Dim)names of the array value are taken from the \code{FUN.VALUE}
if it is named, otherwise from the result of the first function call.
Column names of the matrix or more generally the names of the last
dimension of the array value or names of the vector value are set from
\code{X} as in \code{sapply}.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
\code{sapply(*, simplify = FALSE, USE.NAMES = FALSE)} is
equivalent to \code{lapply(*)}.

For historical reasons, the calls created by \code{lapply} are
unevaluated, and code has been written (e.g. \code{bquote}) that
relies on this.  This means that the recorded call is always of the
form \code{FUN(X[[0L]], ...)}, with \code{0L} replaced by the current
integer index.  This is not normally a problem, but it can be if
\code{FUN} uses \code{\LinkA{sys.call}{sys.call}} or \code{\LinkA{match.call}{match.call}} or
if it is a primitive function that makes use of the call.  This means
that it is often safer to call primitive functions with a wrapper, so
that e.g. \code{lapply(ll, function(x) is.numeric(x))} is required in
\R{} 2.7.1 to ensure that method dispatch for \code{is.numeric} occurs
correctly.

If \code{expr} is a function call, be aware of assumptions about where
it is evaluated, and in particular what \code{...} might refer to.
You can pass additional named arguments to a function call as
additional named arguments to \code{replicate}: see `Examples'.

%
\begin{Details}\relax
Both functions are generic: you can write methods to handle specific
classes of objects, see \LinkA{InternalMethods}{InternalMethods}.  \code{length<-} has a
\code{"factor"} method.

The replacement form can be used to reset the length of a vector.  If
a vector is shortened, extra values are discarded and when a vector is
lengthened, it is padded out to its new length with \code{\LinkA{NA}{NA}}s
(\code{nul} for raw vectors).

Both are \LinkA{primitive}{primitive} functions.

%
\begin{Value}
The default method currently returns an \code{\LinkA{integer}{integer}} of
length 1.  Since this will change in the future and may
differ for other methods, programmers should not rely on it.

For vectors (including lists) and factors the length is the number of
elements.  For an environment it is the number of objects in the
environment, and \code{NULL} has length 0.  For expressions and
pairlists (including language objects and dotlists) it is the length
of the pairlist chain.  All other objects (including functions) have
length one: note that for functions this differs from S.

The replacement form removes all the attributes of \code{x} except its
names, which are adjusted (and if necessary extended by \code{""}).
\end{Value}

Package authors have written methods that return a result of length
other than one (\pkg{Formula}) and that return a vector of type

double value is returned that can be represented as an integer it is
returned as a length-one integer vector.

\begin{Description}\relax
\code{levels} provides access to the levels attribute of a variable.
The first form returns the value of the levels of its argument
and the second sets the attribute.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
levels(x)
levels(x) <- value
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] an object, for example a factor.
\item[\code{value}] A valid value for \code{levels(x)}.
For the default method, \code{NULL} or a character vector.  For the
\code{factor} method, a vector of character strings with length at
least the number of levels of \code{x}, or a named list specifying how to
rename the levels.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
Both the extractor and replacement forms are generic and new methods
can be written for them.  The most important method for the replacement
function is that for \code{\LinkA{factor}{factor}}s.

For the factor replacement method, a \code{NA} in \code{value}
causes that level to be removed from the levels and the elements
formerly with that level to be replaced by \code{NA}.

Note that for a factor, replacing the levels via
\code{levels(x) <- value} is not the same as (and is preferred to)
\code{attr(x, "levels") <- value}.

The replacement function is \LinkA{primitive}{primitive}.

\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{new}] a character vector with the locations of \R{} library
trees.  Tilde expansion (\code{\LinkA{path.expand}{path.expand}}) is done, and if
any element contains one of \code{*?[}, globbing is done where
supported by the platform: see \code{\LinkA{Sys.glob}{Sys.glob}}.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{.Library} is a character string giving the location of the
default library, the \file{library} subdirectory of \env{R\_HOME}.

\code{.Library.site} is a (possibly empty) character vector giving the
locations of the site libraries, by default the \file{site-library}
subdirectory of \env{R\_HOME} (which may not exist).

\code{.libPaths} is used for getting or setting the library trees that
\R{} knows about (and hence uses when looking for packages).  If called
with argument \code{new}, the library search path is set to
the existing directories in \code{unique(c(new, .Library.site, .Library))}
and this is returned.  If given no argument, a character vector with
the currently active library trees is returned.

The library search path is initialized at startup from the environment
variable \env{R\_LIBS} (which should be a semicolon-separated list of
directories at which \R{} library trees are rooted) followed by those in
environment variable \env{R\_LIBS\_USER}.  Only directories which exist
at the time will be included.

By default \env{R\_LIBS} is unset, and \env{R\_LIBS\_USER} is set to
subdirectory \file{R/win-library/\var{x.y}} of the home directory,
for \R{} \var{x.y.z}.

\code{.Library.site} can be set via the environment variable
\env{R\_LIBS\_SITE} (as a non-empty semicolon-separated list of library trees).

Both \env{R\_LIBS\_USER} and \env{R\_LIBS\_SITE} feature possible
expansion of specifiers for \R{} version specific information as part of
the startup process.  The possible conversion specifiers all start
with a \samp{\%} and are followed by a single letter (use \samp{\%\%}
to obtain \samp{\%}), with currently available conversion
specifications as follows:
\begin{description}

\item[\samp{\%V}] \R{} version number including the patchlevel (e.g.,
\samp{2.5.0}).
\item[\samp{\%v}] \R{} version number excluding the patchlevel (e.g.,
\samp{2.5}).
\item[\samp{\%p}] the platform for which \R{} was built, the value of
\code{\LinkA{R.version}{R.version}\$platform}.
\item[\samp{\%o}] the underlying operating system, the value of
\code{\LinkA{R.version}{R.version}\$os}.
\item[\samp{\%a}] the architecture (CPU) \R{} was built on/for, the
value of \code{\LinkA{R.version}{R.version}\$arch}.

\end{description}

(See \code{\LinkA{version}{version}} for details on R version information.)

Function \code{.libPaths} always uses the values of \code{.Library}
and \code{.Library.site} in the base namespace.  \code{.Library.site}
can be set by the site in \file{Rprofile.site}, which should be
followed by a call to \code{.libPaths(.libPaths())} to make use of the
updated value.

For consistency, the paths are always normalized by
\code{\LinkA{normalizePath}{normalizePath}(winslash="/")}.
\end{Details}

\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{package, help}] the name of a package, given as a \LinkA{name}{name} or
literal character string, or a character string, depending on
whether \code{character.only} is \code{FALSE} (default) or
\code{TRUE}).
\item[\code{pos}] the position on the search list at which to attach the
loaded package.  Can also be the name of a position on the current
search list as given by \code{\LinkA{search}{search}()}.
\item[\code{lib.loc}] a character vector describing the location of \R{}
library trees to search through, or \code{NULL}.  The default value
of \code{NULL} corresponds to all libraries currently known to
\code{\LinkA{.libPaths}{.libPaths}()}.
Non-existent library trees are silently ignored.
\item[\code{character.only}] a logical indicating whether \code{package} or
\code{help} can be assumed to be character strings.
\item[\code{logical.return}] logical.  If it is \code{TRUE},  \code{FALSE} or
\code{TRUE} is returned to indicate success.
\item[\code{warn.conflicts}] logical.  If \code{TRUE}, warnings are
printed about \code{\LinkA{conflicts}{conflicts}} from attaching the new
package.  A conflict is a function masking a function,
or a non-function masking a non-function.

\item[\code{keep.source}] logical. Now ignored.
This argument does not apply to packages using lazy-loading:
whether they have kept source is determined when they are installed.

\item[\code{verbose}] a logical.  If \code{TRUE}, additional diagnostics are
printed.
\item[\code{quietly}] a logical.  If \code{TRUE}, no message confirming
package loading is printed, and most often, no errors/warnings are
printed if package loading fails.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{library(package)} and \code{require(package)} both load the
package with name \code{package}.  \code{require} is designed for use
inside other functions; it returns \code{FALSE} and gives a warning
(rather than an error as \code{library()} does by default) if the
package does not exist.  Both functions check and update the list of
currently loaded packages and do not reload a package which is already
loaded.  (Furthermore, if the package has a namespace and a name
space of that name is already loaded, they work from the existing
namespace rather than reloading from the file system.  If you want to
reload such a package, call \code{\LinkA{detach}{detach}(unload = TRUE)} or
\code{\LinkA{unloadNamespace}{unloadNamespace}} first.)

To suppress messages during the loading of packages use
\code{\LinkA{suppressPackageStartupMessages}{suppressPackageStartupMessages}}: this will suppress all
messages from \R{} itself but not necessarily all those from package
authors.

If \code{library} is called with no \code{package} or \code{help}
argument, it lists all available packages in the libraries specified
by \code{lib.loc}, and returns the corresponding information in an
object of class \code{"libraryIQR"}.  The structure of this class may
change in future versions.  In earlier versions of \R{}, only the names
of all available packages were returned; use \code{.packages(all =
    TRUE)} for obtaining these.  Note that
\code{\LinkA{installed.packages}{installed.packages}()}
returns even more information.

\code{library(help = somename)} computes basic information about the
package \code{somename}, and returns this in an object of class
\code{"packageInfo"}.  The structure of this class may change in
future versions.  When used with the default value (\code{NULL}) for
\code{lib.loc}, the attached packages are searched before the libraries.

In versions of \R{} prior to 2.14.0, a \code{.First.lib} function 
would be called when a package without a namespace was attached.
As of 2.14.0, all functions have namespaces; see 
\code{\LinkA{.onLoad}{.onLoad}} for current behaviour, and `Writing R Extensions'
for a description of the older mechanism.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
Normally \code{library} returns (invisibly) the list of attached
packages, but \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} if \code{logical.return} is
\code{TRUE}.  When called as \code{library()} it returns an object of
class \code{"libraryIQR"}, and for \code{library(help=)}, one of
class \code{"packageInfo"}.

\code{require} returns (invisibly) a logical indicating whether the required
package is available.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{Licenses}
Some packages have restrictive licenses, and there is a mechanism to
allow users to be aware of such licenses.  If
\code{\LinkA{getOption}{getOption}("checkPackageLicense") == TRUE}, then at first
use of a package with a not-known-to-be-FOSS (see below) license the
user is asked to view and accept the license: a list of accepted
licenses is stored in file \file{\textasciitilde{}/.R/licensed}.  In a non-interactive
session it is an error to use such a package whose license has not
already been accepted.

Free or Open Source Software (FOSS, e.g.,
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSS}) packages are determined by
the same filters used by \code{\LinkA{available.packages}{available.packages}} but applied
to just the current package, not its dependencies.

There can also be a site-wide file \file{R\_HOME/etc/licensed.site} of
packages (one per line).
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Formal methods}
\code{library} takes some further actions when package \pkg{methods}
is attached (as it is by default).  Packages may define formal generic
functions as well as re-defining functions in other packages (notably
\pkg{base}) to be generic, and this information is cached whenever
such a package is loaded after \pkg{methods} and re-defined functions
(\LinkA{implicit generic}{implicit generic}s) are excluded from the list of conflicts.
The caching  and check for conflicts require looking for a pattern of
objects; the search may be avoided by defining an object
\code{.noGenerics} (with any value) in the package.  Naturally, if the
package \emph{does} have any such methods, this will prevent them from
being used.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
\code{library} and \code{require} can only load an \emph{installed}
package, and this is detected by having a \file{DESCRIPTION} file
containing a \samp{Built:} field.

Under Unix-alikes, the code checks that the package was installed
under a similar operating system as given by \code{R.version\$platform}
(the canonical name of the platform under which R was compiled),
provided it contains compiled code.  Packages which do not contain
compiled code can be shared between Unix-alikes, but not to other OSes
because of potential problems with line endings and OS-specific help
files.  If sub-architectures are used, the OS similarity is not
checked since the OS used to build may differ (e.g.
\code{i386-pc-linux-gnu} code can be built on an
\code{x86\_64-unknown-linux-gnu} OS).

The package name given to \code{library} and \code{require} must match
the name given in the package's \file{DESCRIPTION} file exactly, even
on case-insensitive file systems such as are common on MS Windows and
Mac OS X.

\item[\code{chname}] a character string naming a DLL (also known as a dynamic
shared object or library) to load.
\item[\code{package}] a character vector with the name of package.
\item[\code{lib.loc}] a character vector describing the location of \R{}
library trees to search through.
\item[\code{libpath}] the path to the loaded package whose DLL is to be unloaded.
\item[\code{verbose}] a logical value indicating whether an announcement
is printed on the console before loading the DLL.  The
default value is taken from the verbose entry in the system
\code{\LinkA{options}{options}}.
\item[\code{file.ext}] the extension (including \samp{.} if used) to append
to the file name to specify the library to be loaded.  This defaults
to the appropriate value for the operating system.
\item[\code{...}] additional arguments needed by some libraries that
are passed to the call to \code{\LinkA{dyn.load}{dyn.load}} to control
how the library and its dependencies are loaded.
\item[\code{new}] a list of \code{"DLLInfo"} objects corresponding to the
DLLs loaded by packages.  Can be missing.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
See \code{\LinkA{dyn.load}{dyn.load}} for what sort of objects these functions handle.

\code{library.dynam} is designed to be used inside a package rather
than at the command line, and should really only be used inside
\code{\LinkA{.onLoad}{.onLoad}}.  The system-specific extension for DLLs (e.g.,
\file{.so} or \file{.sl} on Unix-alike systems,
\file{.dll} on Windows) should not be added.

If \code{...} does not include a named argument \code{DLLpath},
\code{\LinkA{dyn.load}{dyn.load}} is called with \code{DLLpath} set to the
package's \file{libs} directory.  See the ``Windows'' section of
the help on \code{\LinkA{dyn.load}{dyn.load}} for how to control where dependent
DLLs are found.

\code{library.dynam.unload} is designed for use in
\code{\LinkA{.onUnload}{.onUnload}}: it unloads the DLL and updates the value of
\code{.dynLibs()}

\code{.dynLibs} is used for getting (with no argument) or setting the
DLLs which are currently loaded by packages (using \code{library.dynam}).

\code{lib.loc} should contain absolute paths: versions of \R{} prior to
2.12.0 may get confused by relative paths.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
If \code{chname} is not specified, \code{library.dynam} returns an
object of class \code{"\LinkA{DLLInfoList}{DLLInfoList}"} corresponding to the DLLs
loaded by packages.

If \code{chname} is specified, an object of class
\code{"\LinkA{DLLInfo}{DLLInfo}"} that identifies the DLL and which can be used
in future calls is returned invisibly.  Note that the class
\code{"\LinkA{DLLInfo}{DLLInfo}"} has a method for \code{\$} which can be used to
resolve native symbols within that DLL.

\code{library.dynam.unload} invisibly returns an object of class
\code{"\LinkA{DLLInfo}{DLLInfo}"} identifying the DLL successfully unloaded.

\code{.dynLibs} returns an object of class \code{"\LinkA{DLLInfoList}{DLLInfoList}"}
corresponding corresponding to its current value.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{Warning}
Do not use \code{\LinkA{dyn.unload}{dyn.unload}} on a DLL loaded by
\code{library.dynam}: use \code{library.dynam.unload} to ensure
that \code{.dynLibs} gets updated.  Otherwise a subsequent call to
\code{library.dynam} will be told the object is already loaded.

Note that whether or not it is possible to unload a DLL and then
reload a revised version of the same file is OS-dependent: see the
`Value' section of the help for  \code{\LinkA{dyn.unload}{dyn.unload}}.

rarely seen by users (except as \code{\LinkA{formals}{formals}} of functions).

The arguments to \code{list} or \code{pairlist} are of the form
\code{value} or \code{tag = value}.  The functions return a list or
dotted pair list composed of its arguments with each value either
tagged or untagged, depending on how the argument was specified.

\code{alist} handles its arguments as if they described function
arguments.  So the values are not evaluated, and tagged arguments with
no value are allowed whereas \code{list} simply ignores them.
\code{alist} is most often used in conjunction with \code{\LinkA{formals}{formals}}.

\code{as.list} attempts to coerce its argument to a list.  For
functions, this returns the concatenation of the list of formal
arguments and the function body.  For expressions, the list of
constituent elements is returned.  \code{as.list} is generic, and as
the default method calls \code{\LinkA{as.vector}{as.vector}(mode="list")} for a
non-list, methods for \code{as.vector} may be invoked.  \code{as.list}
turns a factor into a list of one-element factors.  Attributes may
be dropped unless the argument already is a list or expression.  (This
is inconsistent with functions such as \code{\LinkA{as.character}{as.character}}
which always drop attributes, and is for efficiency since lists can be
expensive to copy.)

\code{is.list} returns \code{TRUE} if and only if its argument
is a \code{list} \emph{or} a \code{pairlist} of \code{length} \eqn{> 0}{}.
\code{is.pairlist} returns \code{TRUE} if and only if the argument
is a pairlist or \code{NULL} (see below).

The \code{"\LinkA{environment}{environment}"} method for \code{as.list} copies the
name-value pairs (for names not beginning with a dot) from an
environment to a named list.  The user can request that all named
objects are copied.  The list is in no particular order (the order
depends on the order of creation of objects and whether the
environment is hashed).  No enclosing environments are searched.
(Objects copied are duplicated so this can be an expensive operation.)
Note that there is an inverse operation, the
\code{\LinkA{as.environment}{as.environment}()} method for list objects.

An empty pairlist, \code{pairlist()} is the same as
\code{\LinkA{NULL}{NULL}}.  This is different from \code{list()}.

\code{as.pairlist} is implemented as \code{\LinkA{as.vector}{as.vector}(x,
  "pairlist")}, and hence will dispatch methods for the generic function
\code{as.vector}.  Lists are copied element-by-element into a pairlist
and the names of the list used as tags for the pairlist: the return
value for other types of argument is undocumented.

\code{list}, \code{is.list} and \code{is.pairlist} are
\LinkA{primitive}{primitive} functions.

list.dirs(path = ".", full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{path}] a character vector of full path names; the default
corresponds to the working directory, \code{\LinkA{getwd}{getwd}()}.  Tilde
expansion (see \code{\LinkA{path.expand}{path.expand}}) is performed.  Missing
values will be ignored.
\item[\code{pattern}] an optional \LinkA{regular expression}{regular expression}.  Only file names
which match the regular expression will be returned.
\item[\code{all.files}] a logical value.  If \code{FALSE}, only the
names of visible files are returned.  If \code{TRUE},
all file names will be returned.
\item[\code{full.names}] a logical value.  If \code{TRUE}, the directory
path is prepended to the file names to give a relative file path.
If \code{FALSE}, the file names (rather than paths) are returned.
\item[\code{recursive}] logical.  Should the listing recurse into directories?
\item[\code{ignore.case}] logical.  Should pattern-matching be case-insensitive?
\item[\code{include.dirs}] logical.  Should subdirectory names be included in
recursive listings?  (There always are in non-recursive ones).
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Value}
A character vector containing the names of the files in the
specified directories, or \code{""} if there were no files.  If a
path does not exist or is not a directory or is unreadable it
is skipped, with a warning.

The files are sorted in alphabetical order, on the full path
if \code{full.names = TRUE}.

\code{list.dirs} implicitly has \code{all.files = TRUE}, and if
\code{recursive = TRUE}, the answer includes \code{path} itself
(provided it is a readable directory). 
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
File naming conventions are platform dependent.  The pattern matching
works with the case of file names as returned by the OS.

\code{path} must specify paths which can be represented in the current
codepage.

\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{file}] a (readable binary-mode) \LinkA{connection}{connection} or a character string

\item[\code{envir}] the environment where the data should be loaded.

%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{load} can load \R{} objects saved in the current or any earlier
format.  It can read a compressed file (see \code{\LinkA{save}{save}})
directly from a file or from a suitable connection (including a call
to \code{\LinkA{url}{url}}).

A not-open connection will be opened in mode \code{"rb"} and closed
after use.  Any connection other than a \code{\LinkA{gzfile}{gzfile}} or
\code{\LinkA{gzcon}{gzcon}} connection will be wrapped in \code{\LinkA{gzcon}{gzcon}}
to allow compressed saves to be handled: note that this leaves the
connection in an altered state (in particular, binary-only), and that
it needs to be closed explicitly (it will not be garbage-collected).

Only \R{} objects saved in the current format (used since \R{} 1.4.0)
can be read from a connection.  If no input is available on a
connection a warning will be given, but any input not in the current
format will result in a error.

Loading from an earlier version will give a warning about the
`magic number': magic numbers \code{1971:1977} are from \R{} <
0.99.0, and \code{RD[ABX]1} from \R{} 0.99.0 to \R{} 1.3.1.  These are all
obsolete, and you are strongly recommended to re-save such files in a
current format.

\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{category}] character string.  The following categories should
always be supported: \code{"LC\_ALL"}, \code{"LC\_COLLATE"},
\code{"LC\_CTYPE"}, \code{"LC\_MONETARY"}, \code{"LC\_NUMERIC"} and
\code{"LC\_TIME"}.  Some systems (not Windows) will also support
\code{"LC\_MESSAGES"}, \code{"LC\_PAPER"} and \code{"LC\_MEASUREMENT"}.

\item[\code{locale}] character string.  A valid locale name on the system in
use.  Normally \code{""} (the default) will pick up the default
locale for the system.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The locale describes aspects of the internationalization of a program.
Initially most aspects of the locale of \R{} are set to \code{"C"} (which
is the default for the C language and reflects North-American usage).
\R{} sets \code{"LC\_CTYPE"} and \code{"LC\_COLLATE"}, which allow the
use of a different character set and alphabetic
comparisons in that character set (including the use of
\code{\LinkA{sort}{sort}}), \code{"LC\_MONETARY"} (for use by
\code{\LinkA{Sys.localeconv}{Sys.localeconv}}) and \code{"LC\_TIME"} may affect
the behaviour of \code{\LinkA{as.POSIXlt}{as.POSIXlt}} and \code{\LinkA{strptime}{strptime}}
and functions which use them (but not \code{\LinkA{date}{date}}).

The first seven categories described here are those specified by
POSIX.  \code{"LC\_MESSAGES"} will be \code{"C"} on systems that do not
support message translation, and is not supported on Windows.  Trying
to use an unsupported category is an error for \code{Sys.setlocale}.

Note that setting category \code{"LC\_ALL"} sets only
\code{"LC\_COLLATE"}, \code{"LC\_CTYPE"}, \code{"LC\_MONETARY"} and
\code{"LC\_TIME"}.

Attempts to set an invalid locale are ignored.  There may or may not
be a warning, depending on the OS.

Attempts to change the character set (by
\code{Sys.setlocale("LC\_TYPE", )}, if that implies a different
character set) during a session may not work and are likely to lead to
some confusion.

Note that the \env{\bsl{}link\{LANGUAGE\}} environment variable has
precedence over code"LC\_MESSAGES" in selecting the language of
message translation on most \R{} platforms.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
A character string of length one describing the locale in use (after
setting for \code{Sys.setlocale}), or an empty character string if the
current locale settings are invalid or \code{NULL} if locale
information is unavailable.

For \code{category = "LC\_ALL"} the details of the string are
system-specific: it might be a single locale name or a set of locale
names separated by \code{"/"} (Solaris, Mac OS X) or \code{";"}
(Windows, Linux).  For portability, it is best to query categories
individually: it is not necessarily the case that the result of
\code{foo <- Sys.getlocale()} can be used in
\code{Sys.setlocale("LC\_ALL", locale = foo)}.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{Warning}
Setting \code{"LC\_NUMERIC"} may cause \R{} to function
anomalously, so gives a warning.  Input conversions
in \R{} itself are unaffected, but the reading and writing of ASCII
\code{\LinkA{save}{save}} files will be, as may packages.

Setting it temporarily on a Unix-alike to produce graphical or text
output may work well enough, but \code{\LinkA{options}{options}(OutDec)} is
often preferable.

Almost all the output routines used by \R{} itself under Windows ignore
the setting of \code{"LC\_NUMERIC"} since they make use of the Trio
library which is not internationalized.
\end{Section}

\code{log} computes logarithms, by default natural logarithms, 
\code{log10} computes common (i.e., base 10) logarithms, and

The general form \code{log(x, base)} computes logarithms with base
\code{base}.

\eqn{|x| \ll 1}{} (and less accurately when \eqn{x \approx
    -1}{}).

\code{exp} computes the exponential function.

\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}

\item[\code{base}] a positive or complex number: the base with respect to which
logarithms are computed.  Defaults to \eqn{e}{}=\code{exp(1)}.

\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
All except \code{logb} are generic functions: methods can be defined
for them individually or via the \code{\LinkA{Math}{S3groupGeneric}}
group generic.

\code{log10} and \code{log2} are only convenience wrappers, but logs
to bases 10 and 2 (whether computed \emph{via} \code{log} or the wrappers)
will be computed more efficiently and accurately where supported by the OS.
Methods can be set for them individually (and otherwise methods for
\code{log} will be used).

\code{logb} is a wrapper for \code{log} for compatibility with S.  If
(S3 or S4) methods are set for \code{log} they will be dispatched.
Do not set S4 methods on \code{logb} itself.

All except \code{log} are \LinkA{primitive}{primitive} functions.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
A vector of the same length as \code{x} containing the transformed
values.  \code{log(0)} gives \code{-Inf}, and \code{log(x)} for
negative values of \code{x} is \code{NaN}.  \code{exp(-Inf)} is \code{0}.

For complex inputs to the log functions, the value is a complex number
with imaginary part in the range \eqn{[-\pi, \pi]}{}: which
end of the range is used might be platform-specific.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{S4 methods}
\code{exp}, \code{expm1}, \code{log}, \code{log10}, \code{log2} and
\code{log1p} are S4 generic and are members of the
\code{\LinkA{Math}{S4groupGeneric}} group generic.

Note that this means that the S4 generic for \code{log} has a
signature with only one argument, \code{x}, but that \code{base} can
be passed to methods (but will not be used for method selection).  On
the other hand, if you only set a method for the \code{Math} group
generic then \code{base} argument of \code{log} will be ignored for
your class.

\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x, y}] logical or `number-like' vectors (i.e., of type
\code{\LinkA{double}{double}} (class \code{\LinkA{numeric}{numeric}}), \code{\LinkA{integer}{integer}},
\code{\LinkA{complex}{complex}} or \code{\LinkA{raw}{raw}}), or objects for
which methods have been written.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{!} indicates logical negation (NOT).

\code{\&} and \code{\&\&} indicate logical AND and \code{|} and \code{||}
indicate logical OR.  The shorter form performs elementwise
comparisons in much the same way as arithmetic operators.  The longer
form evaluates left to right examining only the first element of each
vector.  Evaluation proceeds only until the result is determined.  The
longer form is appropriate for programming control-flow and typically
preferred in \code{\LinkA{if}{if}} clauses.

\code{xor} indicates elementwise exclusive OR.

\code{isTRUE(x)} is an abbreviation of \code{identical(TRUE, x)}, and
so is true if and only if \code{x} is a length-one logical vector
whose only element is \code{TRUE} and which has no attributes (not even
names).

Numeric and complex vectors will be coerced to logical values, with
zero being false and all non-zero values being true.  Raw vectors are
handled without any coercion for \code{!}, \code{\&}, \code{|} and
\code{xor}, with these operators being applied bitwise (so \code{!} is
the 1s-complement).

The operators \code{!}, \code{\&} and \code{|} are generic functions:
methods can be written for them individually or via the
\code{\LinkA{Ops}{S3groupGeneric}} (or S4 \code{Logic}, see below)
group generic function.  (See \code{\LinkA{Ops}{S3groupGeneric}} for
how dispatch is computed.)

\code{\LinkA{NA}{NA}} is a valid logical object.  Where a component of
\code{x} or \code{y} is \code{NA}, the result will be \code{NA} if the
outcome is ambiguous.  In other words \code{NA \& TRUE} evaluates to
\code{NA}, but \code{NA \& FALSE} evaluates to \code{FALSE}.  See the
examples below.

See \LinkA{Syntax}{Syntax} for the precedence of these operators: unlike many
other languages (including S) the AND and OR operators do not have the
same precedence (the AND operators are higher than the OR operators).
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
For \code{!}, a logical or raw vector of the same length as \code{x}:
names, dims and dimnames are copied from \code{x}.

For \code{|}, \code{\&} and \code{xor} a logical or raw vector. The
elements of shorter vectors are recycled as necessary (with a
\code{\LinkA{warning}{warning}} when they are recycled only \emph{fractionally}).
The rules for determining the attributes of the result are rather
complicated.  Most attributes are taken from the longer argument, the
first if they are of the same length.  Names will be copied from the
first if it is the same length as the answer, otherwise from the
second if that is.  For time series, these operations are allowed only
if the series are compatible, when the class and \code{\LinkA{tsp}{tsp}}
attribute of whichever is a time series (the same, if both are) are
used.  For arrays (and an array result) the dimensions and dimnames
are taken from first argument if it is an array, otherwise the second.

For \code{||}, \code{\&\&} and \code{isTRUE}, a length-one logical vector.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{S4 methods}
\code{!}, \code{\&} and \code{|} are S4 generics, the latter two part
of the \code{\LinkA{Logic}{S4groupGeneric}} group generic (and
hence methods need argument names \code{e1, e2}).

\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{length}] A non-negative integer specifying the desired length.
Double values will be coerced to integer:
supplying an argument of length other than one is an error.
\item[\code{x}] object to be coerced or tested.
\item[\code{...}] further arguments passed to or from other methods.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{TRUE} and \code{FALSE} are \LinkA{reserved}{reserved} words denoting logical
constants in the \R{} language, whereas \code{T} and \code{F} are global
variables whose initial values set to these.  All four are
\code{logical(1)} vectors.

Logical vectors are coerced to integer vectors in contexts where a
numerical value is required, with \code{TRUE} being mapped to
\code{1L}, \code{FALSE} to \code{0L} and \code{NA} to \code{NA\_integer\_}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{logical} creates a logical vector of the specified length.
Each element of the vector is equal to \code{FALSE}.

\code{as.logical} attempts to coerce its argument to be of logical
type.  For \code{\LinkA{factor}{factor}}s, this uses the \code{\LinkA{levels}{levels}}
(labels).  Like \code{\LinkA{as.vector}{as.vector}} it strips attributes including
names.  Character strings \code{c("T", "TRUE", "True", "true")} are
regarded as true, \code{c("F", "FALSE", "False", "false")} as false,
and all others as \code{NA}.

\code{is.logical} returns \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} depending on
whether its argument is of logical type or not.

\code{ls} and \code{objects} return a vector of character strings
giving the names of the objects in the specified environment.
When invoked with no argument at the top level prompt,
\code{ls} shows what data sets and functions a user has defined.
When invoked with no argument inside a function,
\code{ls} returns the names of the functions local variables.
This is useful in conjunction with \code{browser}.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
ls(name, pos = -1, envir = as.environment(pos),
   all.names = FALSE, pattern)
objects(name, pos= -1, envir = as.environment(pos),
        all.names = FALSE, pattern)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{name}] which environment to use in listing the available objects.
Defaults to the \emph{current}
environment.  Although called \code{name} for back compatibility, in
fact this argument can specify the environment in any form; see the
details section.
\item[\code{pos}] an alternative argument to \code{name} for specifying the
environment as a position in the search list.  Mostly there for
back compatibility.
\item[\code{envir}] an alternative argument to \code{name} for specifying the
environment.  Mostly there for back compatibility.
\item[\code{all.names}] a logical value.  If \code{TRUE}, all
object names are returned.  If \code{FALSE}, names which begin with a
\samp{.} are omitted.
\item[\code{pattern}] an optional \LinkA{regular expression}{regular expression}.  Only names
matching \code{pattern} are returned.  \code{\LinkA{glob2rx}{glob2rx}} can be
used to convert wildcard patterns to regular expressions.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The \code{name} argument can specify the  environment from which
object names are taken in one of several forms:
as an integer (the position in the \code{\LinkA{search}{search}} list); as
the character string name of an element in the search list; or as an
explicit \code{\LinkA{environment}{environment}} (including using
\code{\LinkA{sys.frame}{sys.frame}} to access the currently active function calls).
By default, the environment of the call to \code{ls} or \code{objects}
is used. The \code{pos} and \code{envir} arguments are an alternative
way to specify an environment, but are primarily there for back
compatibility.

Note that the \emph{order} of the resulting strings is locale
dependent, see \code{\LinkA{Sys.getlocale}{Sys.getlocale}}.

\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
make.names(names, unique = FALSE, allow_ = TRUE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{names}] character vector to be coerced to syntactically valid
names.  This is coerced to character if necessary.
\item[\code{unique}] logical; if \code{TRUE}, the resulting elements are
unique.  This may be desired for, e.g., column names.
\item[\code{allow\_}] logical.  For compatibility with \R{} prior to 1.9.0.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
A syntactically valid name consists of letters, numbers and the dot or
underline characters and starts with a letter or the dot not followed
by a number.  Names such as \code{".2way"} are not valid, and neither
are the \LinkA{reserved}{reserved} words.

The definition of a \emph{letter} depends on the current locale, but
only ASCII digits are considered to be digits.

The character \code{"X"} is prepended if necessary.
All invalid characters are translated to \code{"."}.  A missing value
is translated to \code{"NA"}.  Names which match \R{} keywords have a dot
appended to them.  Duplicated values are altered by
\code{\LinkA{make.unique}{make.unique}}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
A character vector of same length as \code{names} with each changed to
a syntactically valid name, in the current locale's encoding.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{Warning}
Some OSes, notably FreeBSD, report extremely incorrect information about
which characters are alphabetic in some locales (typically, all
multi-byte locales including UTF-8 locales).  However, \R{} provides
substitutes on Windows, OS X and AIX.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
Prior to \R{} version 1.9.0, underscores were not valid in variable names,
and code that relies on them being converted to dots will no longer
work. Use \code{allow\_ = FALSE} for back-compatibility.

\code{allow\_ = FALSE} is also useful when creating names for export to
applications which do not allow underline in names (for example,
S-PLUS and some DBMSs).

\code{match} returns a vector of the positions of (first) matches of

\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] vector or \code{NULL}: the values to be matched.
\item[\code{table}] vector or \code{NULL}: the values to be matched against.
\item[\code{nomatch}] the value to be returned in the case when no match is
found.  Note that it is coerced to \code{integer}.
\item[\code{incomparables}] a vector of values that cannot be matched.  Any
value in \code{x} matching a value in this vector is assigned the
\code{nomatch} value.  For historical reasons, \code{FALSE} is
equivalent to \code{NULL}.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{\%in\%} is currently defined as \\{}
\code{"\%in\%" <- function(x, table) match(x, table, nomatch = 0) > 0}

Factors, raw vectors and lists are converted to character vectors, and
then \code{x} and \code{table} are coerced to a common type (the later
of the two types in \R{}'s ordering, logical < integer < numeric <
complex < character) before matching.  If \code{incomparables} has
positive length it is coerced to the common type.

Matching for lists is potentially very slow and best avoided except in
simple cases.

Exactly what matches what is to some extent a matter of definition.
For all types, \code{NA} matches \code{NA} and no other value.
For real and complex values, \code{NaN} values are regarded
as matching any other \code{NaN} value, but not matching \code{NA}.

That \code{\%in\%} never returns \code{NA} makes it particularly
useful in \code{if} conditions.

Character strings will be compared as byte sequences if any input is
marked as \code{"bytes"}.

\code{match}: An integer vector giving the position in \code{table} of
the first match if there is a match, otherwise \code{nomatch}.

If \code{x[i]} is found to equal \code{table[j]} then the value

\code{match.arg} matches \code{arg} against a table of candidate
values as specified by \code{choices}, where \code{NULL} means to take
the first one.
\end{Description}

\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
match.arg(arg, choices, several.ok = FALSE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{arg}] a character vector (of length one unless \code{several.ok}
is \code{TRUE}) or \code{NULL}.
\item[\code{choices}] a character vector of candidate values
\item[\code{several.ok}] logical specifying if \code{arg} should be allowed

%
\begin{Details}\relax
In the one-argument form \code{match.arg(arg)}, the choices are
obtained from a default setting for the formal argument \code{arg} of
the function from which \code{match.arg} was called.  (Since default
argument matching will set \code{arg} to \code{choices}, this is
allowed as an exception to the `length one unless
\code{several.ok} is \code{TRUE}' rule, and returns the first
element.)

Matching is done using \code{\LinkA{pmatch}{pmatch}}, so \code{arg} may be
abbreviated.

\end{Details}

\begin{Value}
The unabbreviated version of the exact or unique partial match if
there is one; otherwise, an error is signalled if \code{several.ok} is
false, as per default.  When \code{several.ok} is true and more than
one element of \code{arg} has a match, all unabbreviated versions of
matches are returned.

%
\begin{Details}\relax
`function' on this help page means an interpreted function
(also known as a `closure'):  \code{match.call} does not support
primitive functions (where argument matching is normally
positional).

\code{match.call} is most commonly used in two circumstances:
\begin{itemize}

\item To record the call for later re-use: for example most
model-fitting functions record the call as element \code{call} of
the list they return.  Here the default \code{expand.dots = TRUE}
is appropriate.

\item To pass most of the call to another function, often
\code{model.frame}.  Here the common idiom is that
\code{expand.dots = FALSE} is used, and the \code{...} element
of the matched call is removed.  An alternative is to
explicitly select the arguments to be passed on, as is done in
\code{lm}.

\end{itemize}


Calling \code{match.call} outside a function without specifying
\code{definition} is an error.

\item[\code{descend}] logical; control whether to search past non-function
objects.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{match.fun} is not intended to be used at the top level since it
will perform matching in the \emph{parent} of the caller.

If \code{FUN} is a function, it is returned.  If it is a symbol (for
example, enclosed in backquotes) or a
character vector of length one, it will be looked up using \code{get}
in the environment of the parent of the caller.  If it is of any other
mode, it is attempted first to get the argument to the caller as a
symbol (using \code{substitute} twice), and if that fails, an error is
declared.

If \code{descend = TRUE}, \code{match.fun} will look past non-function
objects with the given name; otherwise if \code{FUN} points to a
non-function object then an error is generated.

This is used in base functions such as \code{\LinkA{apply}{apply}},
\code{\LinkA{lapply}{lapply}}, \code{\LinkA{outer}{outer}}, and \code{\LinkA{sweep}{sweep}}.

\begin{Section}{Bugs}
The \code{descend} argument is a bit of misnomer and probably not
actually needed by anything.  It may go away in the future.

It is impossible to fully foolproof this.  If one \code{attach}es a
list or data frame containing a length-one character vector with the
same name as a function, it may be used (although namespaces
will help).

\item[\code{nrow}] the desired number of rows.
\item[\code{ncol}] the desired number of columns.
\item[\code{byrow}] logical. If \code{FALSE} (the default) the matrix is
filled by columns, otherwise the matrix is filled by rows.
\item[\code{dimnames}] A \code{\LinkA{dimnames}{dimnames}} attribute for the matrix:
\code{NULL} or a \code{list} of length 2 giving the row and column
names respectively.  An empty list is treated as \code{NULL}, and a
list of length one as row names.  The list can be named, and the
list names will be used as names for the dimensions.
\item[\code{x}] an \R{} object.
\item[\code{...}] additional arguments to be passed to or from methods.
\item[\code{rownames.force}] logical indicating if the resulting matrix
should have character (rather than \code{NULL})
\code{\LinkA{rownames}{rownames}}.  The default, \code{NA}, uses \code{NULL}
rownames if the data frame has `automatic' row.names or for a
zero-row data frame.

%
\begin{Details}\relax
If one of \code{nrow} or \code{ncol} is not given, an attempt is
made to infer it from the length of \code{data} and the other
parameter.  If neither is given, a one-column matrix is returned.

If there are too few elements in \code{data} to fill the matrix,
then the elements in \code{data} are recycled.  If \code{data} has
length zero, \code{NA} of an appropriate type is used for atomic
vectors (\code{0} for raw vectors) and \code{NULL} for lists.

\code{is.matrix} returns \code{TRUE} if \code{x} is a vector and has a
\code{"\LinkA{dim}{dim}"} attribute of length 2) and \code{FALSE} otherwise.
Note that a \code{\LinkA{data.frame}{data.frame}} is \strong{not} a matrix by this
test.  The function is generic: you can write methods to handle
specific classes of objects, see \LinkA{InternalMethods}{InternalMethods}.

\code{as.matrix} is a generic function.  The method for data frames
will return a character matrix if there is any
non-(numeric/logical/complex) column, applying \code{\LinkA{format}{format}} to
non-character columns.  Otherwise, the usual coercion hierarchy
(logical < integer < double < complex) will be used, e.g., all-logical
data frames will be coerced to a logical matrix, mixed logical-integer
will give a integer matrix, etc.

The default method for \code{as.matrix} calls \code{as.vector(x)}, and
hence e.g. coerces factors to character vectors.

When coercing a vector, it produces a one-column matrix, and
promotes the names (if any) of the vector to the rownames of the matrix.

\code{is.matrix} is a \LinkA{primitive}{primitive} function.

\begin{alltt}  dim(x) <- c(nx, ny)

will avoid duplicating \code{x}.

In-memory compression or decompression for raw vectors.

\begin{verbatim}
memCompress(from, type = c("gzip", "bzip2", "xz", "none"))

memDecompress(from,

\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{from}] A raw vector.  For \code{memCompress} a character vector
will be converted to a raw vector with character strings separated
by \code{"\bsl{}n"}.
\item[\code{type}] character string, the type of compression.  May be
abbreviated to a single letter, defaults to the first of the alternatives.
\item[\code{asChar}] logical: should the result be converted to a character
string?
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{type = "none"} passes the input through unchanged, but may be
useful if \code{type} is a variable.

\code{type = "unknown"} attempts to detect the type of compression
applied (if any): this will always succeed for \command{bzip2}
compression, and will succeed for other forms if there is a suitable
header.  It will auto-detect the `magic' header
(\code{"\bsl{}x1f\bsl{}x8b"}) added to files by the \command{gzip} program (and
to files written by \code{\LinkA{gzfile}{gzfile}}), but \code{memCompress} does
not add such a header.

\command{bzip2} compression always adds a header (\code{"BZh"}).

Compressing with \code{type = "xz"} is equivalent to compressing a
file with \command{xz -9e} (including adding the `magic'
header): decompression should cope with the contents of any file
compressed with \command{xz} version 4.999 and some versions of
\command{lzma}.  There are other versions, in particular `raw'
streams, that are not currently handled.

All the types of compression can expand the input: for \code{"gzip"}
and \code{"bzip"} the maximum expansion is known and so
\code{memCompress} can always allocate sufficient space.  For
\code{"xz"} it is possible (but extremely unlikely) that compression
will fail if the output would have been too large.

How \R{} manages its workspace.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\R{} has a variable-sized workspace.  Prior to \R{} 2.15.0 there were
(rarely-used) command-line options to control its size, but it is now
sized automatically.

On Windows the \option{--max-mem-size} option (or environment variable
\env{R\_MAX\_MEM\_SIZE}) sets the maximum memory allocation: it has a
minimum allowed value of 32M.  This is intended to catch attempts to
allocate excessive amounts of memory which may cause other processes
to run out of resources.  See also \code{\LinkA{memory.limit}{memory.limit}}.

\R{} maintains separate areas for fixed and variable sized objects.  The
first of these is allocated as an array of \emph{cons cells} (Lisp
programmers will know what they are, others may think of them as the
building blocks of the language itself, parse trees, etc.), and the
second are thrown on a \emph{heap} of `Vcells' of 8 bytes each.
Each cons cell occupies 28 bytes on a 32-bit build of \R{}, (usually) 56
bytes on a 64-bit build.

The default values are (currently) an initial setting of 350k cons
cells, 6Mb of vector heap: note that the areas are not actually
allocated initially: rather these values are the sizes for triggering
garbage collection.  Thereafter \R{} will grow or shrink the areas
depending on usage, never decreasing below the initial values.

You can find out the current memory consumption (the heap and cons
cells used as numbers and megabytes) by typing \code{\LinkA{gc}{gc}()} at the
\R{} prompt.  Note that following \code{\LinkA{gcinfo}{gcinfo}(TRUE)}, automatic
garbage collection always prints memory use statistics.

The command-line option \option{--max-ppsize} controls the maximum
size of the pointer protection stack.  This defaults to 50000, but can
be increased to allow deep recursion or large and complicated
calculations to be done.  \emph{Note} that parts of the garbage
collection process goes through the full reserved pointer protection
stack and hence becomes slower when the size is increased.  Currently
the maximum value accepted is 500000.

\begin{Description}\relax
\R{} holds objects it is using in virtual memory.  This help file
documents the current design limitations on large objects: these
differ between 32-bit and 64-bit builds of \R{}.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
Currently \R{} runs on 32- and 64-bit operating systems, and most 64-bit
OSes (including Linux, Solaris, Windows and Mac OS X) can run either
32- or 64-bit builds of \R{}.  The memory limits depends mainly on the
build, but for a 32-bit build of \R{} on Windows they also depend on the
underlying OS version.

\R{} holds all objects in memory, and there are limits based on the
amount of memory that can be used by all objects:
\begin{itemize}

\item There may be limits on the size of the heap and the number of
cons cells allowed -- see \code{\LinkA{Memory}{Memory}} -- but these are
usually not imposed.
\item There is a limit on the (user) address space of a single
process such as the \R{} executable.  This is system-specific, and can
depend on the executable.
\item The environment may impose limitations on the resources
available to a single process: Windows' versions of \R{} do so directly.

\end{itemize}

Error messages beginning \code{cannot allocate vector of size}
indicate a failure to obtain memory, either because the size exceeded
the address-space limit for a process or, more likely, because the
system was unable to provide the memory.  Note that on a 32-bit build
there may well be enough free memory available, but not a large enough
contiguous block of address space into which to map it.

There are also limits on individual objects.  On all builds of \R{},
the maximum length (number of elements) of a vector is
\eqn{2^{31} - 1 \approx 2\thinspace 10^9}{}, as
lengths are stored as signed integers.  In addition, the storage space
cannot exceed the address limit, and if you try to exceed that limit,
the error message begins \code{cannot allocate vector of length}.
The number of bytes in a character string is limited to
\eqn{2^{31} - 1 \approx 2\thinspace 10^9}{}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Section}{Unix}
The address-space limit is system-specific: 32-bit OSes
imposes a limit of no more than 4Gb: it is often 3Gb.  Running
32-bit executables on a 64-bit OS will have similar limits: 64-bit
executables will have an essentially infinite system-specific limit
(e.g. 128Tb for Linux on x86\_64 cpus).

See the OS/shell's help on commands such as \code{limit} or
\code{ulimit} for how to impose limitations on the resources available
to a single process.  For example a \command{bash} user could use
\begin{alltt}ulimit -t 600 -v 4000000
\end{alltt}

whereas a \command{csh} user might use
\begin{alltt}limit cputime 10m
limit vmemoryuse 4096m
\end{alltt}

to limit a process to 10 minutes of CPU time and (around) 4Gb of
virtual memory.  (There are other options to set the RAM in use, but they
are not generally honoured.)
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Windows}
The address-space limit is 2Gb under 32-bit Windows unless the OS's
default has been changed to allow more (up to 3Gb).  See
\url{http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/platform/server/PAE/PAEmem.mspx}
and
\url{http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb613473(VS.85).aspx}.
Under most 64-bit versions of Windows the limit for a 32-bit build
of \R{} is 4Gb: for the oldest ones it is 2Gb.  The limit for a 64-bit
build of \R{} (imposed by the OS) is 8Tb.

It is not normally possible to allocate as much as 2Gb to a single
vector in a 32-bit build of \R{} even on 64-bit Windows because of
preallocations by Windows in the middle of the address space.

Under Windows, \R{} imposes limits on the total memory allocation
available to a single session as the OS provides no way to do so: see
\code{\LinkA{memory.size}{memory.size}} and \code{\LinkA{memory.limit}{memory.limit}}.

usually filled with values from \code{y}.  The default is

\item[\code{all.y}] logical; analogous to \code{all.x}.
\item[\code{sort}] logical.  Should the result be sorted on the \code{by}

\item[\code{suffixes}] a character vector of length 2 specifying the suffixes
to be used for making unique the names of columns in the result
which not used for merging (appearing in \code{by} etc).
\item[\code{incomparables}] values which cannot be matched.  See
\code{\LinkA{match}{match}}.
\item[\code{...}] arguments to be passed to or from methods.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{merge} is a generic function whose principal method is for data
frames: the default method coerces its arguments to data frames and
calls the \code{"data.frame"} method.

By default the data frames are merged on the columns with names they
both have, but separate specifications of the columns can be given by
\code{by.x} and \code{by.y}.  The rows in the two data frames that
match on the specified columns are extracted, and joined together.  If
there is more than one match, all possible matches contribute one row
each.  For the precise meaning of `match', see
\code{\LinkA{match}{match}}.

Columns to merge on can be specified by name, number or by a logical
vector: the name \code{"row.names"} or the number \code{0} specifies
the row names.  If specified by name it must correspond uniquely to a
named column in the input.

If \code{by} or both \code{by.x} and \code{by.y} are of length 0 (a
length zero vector or \code{NULL}), the result, \code{r}, is the
\emph{Cartesian product} of \code{x} and \code{y}, i.e.,
\code{dim(r) = c(nrow(x)*nrow(y), ncol(x) + ncol(y))}.

If \code{all.x} is true, all the non matching cases of \code{x} are
appended to the result as well, with \code{NA} filled in the
corresponding columns of \code{y};  analogously for \code{all.y}.

If the columns in the data frames not used in merging have any common
names, these have \code{suffixes} (\code{".x"} and \code{".y"} by
default) appended to try to make the names of the result unique.  If
this is not possible, an error is thrown.

The complexity of the algorithm used is proportional to the length of
the answer.


In SQL database terminology, the default value of \code{all = FALSE}
gives a \emph{natural join}, a special case of an \emph{inner
join}. Specifying \code{all.x = TRUE} gives a \emph{left (outer)
join}, \code{all.y = TRUE} a \emph{right (outer) join}, and both
(\code{all = TRUE} a \emph{(full) outer join}.  DBMSes do not match
\code{NULL} records, equivalent to \code{incomparables = NA} in \R{}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
A data frame.  The rows are by default lexicographically sorted on the
common columns, but for \code{sort = FALSE} are in an unspecified order.
The columns are the common columns followed by the
remaining columns in \code{x} and then those in \code{y}.  If the
matching involved row names, an extra character column called
\code{Row.names} is added at the left, and in all cases the result has
`automatic' row names.
\end{Value}

This is intended to work with data frames with vector-like columns:
some aspects work with data frames containing matrices, but not all.

\code{message} is used for generating `simple' diagnostic
messages which are neither warnings nor errors, but nevertheless
represented as conditions.  Unlike warnings and errors, a final
newline is regarded as part of the message, and is optional.
The default handler sends the message to the
\code{\LinkA{stderr}{stderr}()} \LinkA{connection}{connection}.

If a condition object is supplied  to \code{message} it should be
the only argument, and further arguments will be ignored, with a warning.

While the message is being processed, a \code{muffleMessage} restart
is available.

\code{suppressMessages} evaluates its expression in a context that
ignores all `simple' diagnostic messages.

\code{packageStartupMessage} is a variant whose messages can be
suppressed separately by \code{suppressPackageStartupMessages}.  (They
are still messages, so can be suppressed by \code{suppressMessages}.)

\code{.makeMessage} is a utility used by \code{message}, \code{warning}
and \code{stop} to generate a text message from the \code{...}
arguments by possible translation (see \code{\LinkA{gettext}{gettext}}) and

\code{missing(x)} is only reliable if \code{x} has not been altered

The example shows how a plotting function can be written to work with
either a pair of vectors giving x and y coordinates of points to be
plotted or a single vector giving y values to be plotted against their
indices.

Currently \code{missing} can only be used in the immediate body of
the function that defines the argument, not in the body of a nested
function or a \code{local} call.  This may change in the future.

This is a `special' \LinkA{primitive}{primitive} function: it must not

\begin{Details}\relax
Both \code{mode} and \code{storage.mode} return a character string
giving the (storage) mode of the object --- often the same --- both
relying on the output of \code{\LinkA{typeof}{typeof}(x)}, see the example
below.

\code{mode(x) <- "newmode"} changes the \code{mode} of object \code{x} to
\code{newmode}.  This is only supported if there is an appropriate
\code{as.newmode} function, for example
\code{"logical"}, \code{"integer"}, \code{"double"}, \code{"complex"},
\code{"raw"}, \code{"character"}, \code{"list"}, \code{"expression"},
\code{"name"}, \code{"symbol"} and \code{"function"}.  Attributes are
preserved (but see below).

\code{storage.mode(x) <- "newmode"} is a more efficient \LinkA{primitive}{primitive}
version of \code{mode<-}, which works for \code{"newmode"} which is
one of the internal types (see \code{\LinkA{typeof}{typeof}}), but not for
\code{"single"}.  Attributes are preserved.

As storage mode \code{"single"} is only a pseudo-mode in \R{}, it will
not be reported by \code{mode} or \code{storage.mode}: use
\code{attr(object, "Csingle")} to examine this.  However,
\code{mode<-} can be used to set the mode to \code{"single"},
which sets the real mode to \code{"double"} and the \code{"Csingle"}
attribute to \code{TRUE}.  Setting any other mode will remove this
attribute.

Note (in the examples below) that some \code{\LinkA{call}{call}}s have mode
\code{"("} which is S compatible.

\begin{Description}\relax
\code{NA} is a logical constant of length 1 which contains a missing
value indicator.  \code{NA} can be coerced to any other vector
type except raw.  There are also constants \code{NA\_integer\_},
\code{NA\_real\_}, \code{NA\_complex\_} and \code{NA\_character\_} of the
other atomic vector types which support missing values: all of these
are \LinkA{reserved}{reserved} words in the \R{} language.

The generic function \code{is.na} indicates which elements are missing.

The generic function \code{is.na<-} sets elements to \code{NA}.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
NA
is.na(x)
## S3 method for class 'data.frame'
is.na(x)

is.na(x) <- value
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] an \R{} object to be tested: the default method handles atomic
vectors, lists and pairlists.
\item[\code{value}] a suitable index vector for use with \code{x}.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The \code{NA} of character type is distinct from the
string \code{"NA"}.  Programmers who need to specify an explicit
string \code{NA} should use \code{NA\_character\_} rather than
\code{"NA"}, or set elements to \code{NA} using \code{is.na<-}.

\code{is.na(x)} works elementwise when \code{x} is a
\code{\LinkA{list}{list}}.  It is generic: you can write methods to handle
specific classes of objects, see \LinkA{InternalMethods}{InternalMethods}.  A complex
value is regarded as \code{NA} if either its real or imaginary part is
\code{NA} or \code{NaN}.

Function \code{is.na<-} may provide a safer way to set missingness.
It behaves differently for factors, for example.

Computations using \code{NA} will normally result in \code{NA}: a
possible exception is where \code{\LinkA{NaN}{NaN}} is also involved, in
which case either might result.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
The default method for \code{is.na} applied to an atomic vector
returns a logical vector of the same length as its argument \code{x},
containing \code{TRUE} for those elements marked \code{NA} or, for
numeric or complex vectors, \code{\LinkA{NaN}{NaN}} (!) and \code{FALSE}
otherwise.  \code{dim}, \code{dimnames} and \code{names} attributes
are preserved.

The default method also works for lists and pairlists: the result for an
element is false unless that element is a length-one atomic vector and
the single element of that vector is regarded as \code{NA} or \code{NaN}.

The method \code{is.na.data.frame} returns a logical matrix with the
same dimensions as the data frame, and with dimnames taken from the
row and column names of the data frame.

\begin{Description}\relax
A `name' (also known as a `symbol') is a way to refer to
\R{} objects by name (rather than the value of the object, if any, bound
to that name).

\code{as.name} and \code{as.symbol} are identical: they attempt to
coerce the argument to a name.

\code{is.symbol} and the identical \code{is.name} return \code{TRUE}
or \code{FALSE} depending on whether the argument is a name or not.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}

as.symbol(x)
is.symbol(x)

as.name(x)
is.name(x)
\end{verbatim}

%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] object to be coerced or tested.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
Names are limited to 10,000 bytes (and were to 256 bytes in versions
of \R{} before 2.13.0).

\code{as.name} first coerces its argument internally to a character
vector (so methods for \code{as.character} are not used).  It then
takes the first element and provided it is not \code{""}, returns a
symbol of that name (and if the element is \code{NA\_character\_}, the
name is \code{`NA`}).

\code{as.name} is implemented as \code{\LinkA{as.vector}{as.vector}(x, "symbol")},
and hence will dispatch methods for the generic function \code{as.vector}.

\code{is.name} and \code{is.symbol} are \LinkA{primitive}{primitive} functions.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
For \code{as.name} and \code{as.symbol}, an \R{} object of type
\code{"symbol"} (see \code{\LinkA{typeof}{typeof}}).

For \code{is.name} and \code{is.symbol}, a length-one logical vector
with value \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
The term `symbol' is from the LISP background of \R{}, whereas
`name' has been the standard S term for this.

\code{NULL}.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{names} is a generic accessor function, and \code{names<-} is a
generic replacement function.  The default methods get and set
the \code{"names"} attribute of a vector (including a list) or
pairlist.

If \code{value} is shorter than \code{x}, it is extended by character
\code{NA}s to the length of \code{x}.

It is possible to update just part of the names attribute via the
general rules: see the examples.  This works because the expression
there is evaluated as \code{z <- "names<-"(z, "[<-"(names(z), 3, "c2"))}.

The name \code{""} is special: it is used to indicate that there is no
name associated with an element of a (atomic or generic) vector.
Subscripting by \code{""} will match nothing (not even elements which
have no name).

A name can be character \code{NA}, but such a name will never be
matched and is likely to lead to confusion.

Both are \LinkA{primitive}{primitive} functions.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
For \code{names}, \code{NULL} or a character vector of the same length
as \code{x}.  (\code{NULL} is given if the object has no names,
including for objects of types which cannot have names.)

For \code{names<-}, the updated object.  (Note that the value of
\code{names(x) <- value} is that of the assignment, \code{value}, not
the return value from the left-hand side.)
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
For vectors, the names are one of the \LinkA{attributes}{attributes} with
restrictions on the possible values.  For pairlists, the names are the
tags and converted to and from a character vector.

For a one-dimensional array the \code{names} attribute really is
\code{\LinkA{dimnames}{dimnames}[[1]]}.

Formally classed aka ``S4'' objects typically have
\code{\LinkA{slotNames}{slotNames}()} (and no \code{names()}).

\code{nchar} takes a character vector as an argument and

the corresponding elements of \code{x}.

\code{nzchar} is a fast way to find out if elements of a character
vector are non-empty strings.
\end{Description}

\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
nchar(x, type = "chars", allowNA = FALSE)

nzchar(x)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] character vector, or a vector to be coerced to a character
vector.  Giving a factor is an error.
\item[\code{type}] character string: partial matching to one of
\code{c("bytes", "chars", "width")}.  See `Details'.
\item[\code{allowNA}] logical: should \code{NA} be returned for invalid
multibyte strings or \code{"bytes"}-encoded strings (rather than
throwing an error)?
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The `size' of a character string can be measured in one of
three ways
\begin{description}

\item[\code{bytes}] The number of bytes needed to store the string
(plus in C a final terminator which is not counted).
\item[\code{chars}] The number of human-readable characters.
\item[\code{width}] The number of columns \code{cat} will use to
print the string in a monospaced font.  The same as \code{chars}
if this cannot be calculated.

\end{description}

These will often be the same, and almost always will be in single-byte
locales.  There will be differences between the first two with
multibyte character sequences, e.g. in UTF-8 locales.

The internal equivalent of the default method of
\code{\LinkA{as.character}{as.character}} is performed on \code{x} (so there is no
method dispatch).  If you want to operate on non-vector objects
passing them through \code{\LinkA{deparse}{deparse}} first will be required.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
For \code{nchar}, an integer vector giving the sizes of each element,
currently always \code{2} for missing values (for \code{NA}).

If \code{allowNA = TRUE} and an element is invalid in a multi-byte
character set such as UTF-8, its number of characters and the width
will be \code{NA}.  Otherwise the number of characters will be
non-negative, so \code{!is.na(nchar(x, "chars", TRUE))} is a test of
validity.

A character string marked with \code{"bytes"} encoding has a number of
bytes, but neither a known number of characters nor a width, so the
latter two types are \code{NA} if \code{allowNA = TRUE}, otherwise an
error.

Names, dims and dimnames are copied from the input.

For \code{nzchar}, a logical vector of the same length as \code{x},
true if and only if the element has non-zero length.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
This does \strong{not} by default give the number of characters that
will be used to \code{print()} the string.  Use
\code{\LinkA{encodeString}{encodeString}} to find the characters used to print the
string.
This is particularly important on Windows when \samp{\bsl{}uxxxx}
sequences have been used to enter Unicode characters not representable
in the current encoding.  Thus \code{nchar("\bsl{}u2642")} is \code{1},
and it is printed in \code{Rgui} as one character, but it will be
printed in \code{Rterm} as \code{<U+2642>}, which is what
\code{encodeString} gives.

\begin{Description}\relax
Computes a matrix norm of \code{x} using Lapack.  The norm can be
the one (\code{"O"}) norm, the infinity (\code{"I"}) norm, the
Frobenius (\code{"F"}) norm, the maximum modulus (\code{"M"}) among
elements of a matrix, or the ``spectral'' or \code{"2"}-norm, as
determined by the value of \code{type}.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
norm(x, type = c("O", "I", "F", "M", "2"))
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] numeric matrix; note that packages such as \Rhref{http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Matrix}{\pkg{Matrix}}
define more \code{norm()} methods.
\item[\code{type}] character string, specifying the \emph{type} of matrix
norm to be computed.
A character indicating the type of norm desired.
\begin{description}

\item[\code{"O"}, \code{"o"} or \code{"1"}] specifies the \bold{o}ne norm,
(maximum absolute column sum);
\item[\code{"I"} or \code{"i"}] specifies the \bold{i}nfinity norm (maximum
absolute row sum);
\item[\code{"F"} or \code{"f"}] specifies the \bold{F}robenius norm (the
Euclidean norm of \code{x} treated as if it were a vector);
\item[\code{"M"} or \code{"m"}] specifies the \bold{m}aximum modulus of
all the elements in \code{x}; and
\item[\code{"2"}] specifies the ``spectral'' or 2-norm, which
is the largest singular value (\code{\LinkA{svd}{svd}}) of \code{x}.

\end{description}

The default is \code{"O"}.  Only the first character of
\code{type[1]} is used.

%
\begin{Details}\relax
Tilde-expansion (see \code{\LinkA{path.expand}{path.expand}}) is first done on
\code{paths} (as from \R{} 2.13.0).

Where the Unix-alike platform supports it attempts to turn paths into
absolute paths in their canonical form (no \samp{./}, \samp{../} nor
symbolic links).  It relies on the POSIX system function
\code{realpath}: if the platform does not have that (we know of no
current example) then the result will be an absolute path but might
not be canonical.  Even where \code{realpath} is used the canonical
path need not be unique, for example \emph{via} hard links or
multiple mounts.

On Windows it converts relative paths to absolute paths, converts
short names for path elements to long names and ensures the separator
is that specified by \code{winslash}.  It will match paths
case-insensitively and return the canonical case.
UTF-8-encoded paths not valid in the current locale can be used.

\code{mustWork = FALSE} is useful for expressing paths for use in
messages.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
A character vector.

If an input is not a real path the result is system-dependent (unless
\code{mustWork = TRUE}, when this should be an error).  It will be
either the corresponding input element or a transformation of it into
an absolute path.

Converting to an absolute file path can fail for a large number of
reasons.  The most common are
\begin{itemize}

\item One of more components of the file path does not exist.
\item A component before the last is not a directory, or there is
insufficient permission to read the directory.
\item For a relative path, the current directory cannot be
determined.
\item A symbolic link points to a non-existent place or links form a
loop.
\item The canonicalized path would be exceed the maximum supported
length of a file path.

environment \code{package:pkg} (which does not exist until the
package's namespace is attached): the latter may contain objects not
exported from the namespace.  As from \R{} 2.14.0 it can access datasets
made available by lazy-loading.

%
\begin{Details}\relax
After loading, \code{\LinkA{loadNamespace}{loadNamespace}} looks for a hook function
named \code{.onLoad} and calls it (with two unnamed arguments) before
sealing the namespace and processing exports.

When the package is attached (via \code{\LinkA{library}{library}} or
\code{\LinkA{attachNamespace}{attachNamespace}}), the hook function \code{.onAttach} is
looked for and if found is called (with two unnamed arguments) before
the package environment is sealed.

If a function \code{\LinkA{.Last.lib}{.Last.lib}} is exported in the package, it
will be called (with a single argument) when the package is detached.
Beware that it might be called if \code{.onAttach} has failed, so it
should be written defensively.  (It is called within
\code{\LinkA{try}{try}}, so errors will not stop the package being
detached.)

If a namespace is unloaded (via \code{\LinkA{unloadNamespace}{unloadNamespace}}), a hook
function \code{.onUnload} is run (with a single argument) before final
unloading.

Note that the code in \code{.onLoad} and \code{.onUnload} is run
without the package being on the search path, but (unless circumvented)
lexical scope will make objects in the namespace and its imports
visible.  (Do not use the double colon operator in \code{.onLoad} as
exports have not been processed at the point it is run.)

\code{.onLoad}, \code{.onUnload} and \code{.onAttach} are looked for
as internal objects in the namespace and should not be exported
(whereas \code{.Last.lib} should be).

Anything needed for the functioning of the namespace should be
handled at load/unload times by the \code{.onLoad} and
\code{.onUnload} hooks.  For example, DLLs can be loaded (unless done
by a \code{useDynLib} directive in the \file{NAMESPACE} file) and
initialized in \code{.onLoad} and unloaded in \code{.onUnload}.  Use
\code{.onAttach} only for actions that are needed only when the
package becomes visible to the user (for example a start-up message)
or need to be run after the package environment has been created.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Section}{Good practice}
Loading a namespace should where possible be silent, with startup
messages given by \code{.onAttach}.  These messages (and any essential
ones from \code{.onLoad}) should use \code{\LinkA{packageStartupMessage}{packageStartupMessage}}
so they can be silenced where they would be a distraction.

There should be no calls to \code{library} nor \code{require} in these
hooks.  The way for a package to load other packages is via the
\samp{Depends} field in the \file{DESCRIPTION} file: this ensures
that the dependence is documented and packages are loaded in the
correct order.  Loading a namespace should not change the search path,
so rather than attach a package, dependence of a namespace on another
package should be achieved by (selectively) importing from the other
package's namespace.

As from \R{} 2.14.0, uses of \code{library} with argument \code{help} to
display basic information about the package should use \code{format}
on the computed package information object and pass this to
\code{packageStartupMessage}.

There should be no calls to \code{\LinkA{installed.packages}{installed.packages}} in startup
code: it is potentially very slow and may fail in versions of \R{}
before 2.14.2 if package installation is going on in parallel.  See
its help page for alternatives.

\begin{Details}\relax
The functions \code{loadNamespace} and \code{attachNamespace} are
usually called implicitly when \code{library} is used to load a name
space and any imports needed.  However it may be useful to call
these functions directly at times.

\code{loadNamespace} loads the specified namespace and registers it in
an internal data base.  A request to load a namespace when one of that
name is already loaded has no effect.  The arguments have the same
meaning as the corresponding arguments to \code{\LinkA{library}{library}}, whose
help page explains the details of how a particular installed package
comes to be chosen.  After loading, \code{loadNamespace} looks for a
hook function named \code{\LinkA{.onLoad}{.onLoad}} as an internal variable in
the namespace (it should not be exported).  This function is called
with the same arguments as \code{.First.lib}.  Partial loading is used
to support installation with the \option{--lazy} option.

\code{loadNamespace} does not attach the namespace it loads to the
search path.  \code{attachNamespace} can be used to attach a frame
containing the exported values of a namespace to the search path (but
this is almost always done \emph{via} \code{\LinkA{library}{library}}).  The
hook function \code{\LinkA{.onAttach}{.onAttach}} is run after the namespace
exports are attached.

\code{requireNamespace} is a wrapper for \code{loadNamespace}
analogous to \code{\LinkA{require}{require}} that returns a logical value.

\code{loadedNamespaces} returns a character vector of the names of
the loaded namespaces.

\code{unloadNamespace} can be used to attempt to force a namespace to
be unloaded.  If the namespace is attached, it is first
\code{\LinkA{detach}{detach}}ed, thereby running a \code{.Last.lib} function
in the namespace if one is exported.  Then an error is signaled if the
namespace is imported by other loaded namespaces, and the namespace
is not unloaded.  If defined, a hook function \code{\LinkA{.onUnload}{.onUnload}}
is run before removing the namespace from the internal registry.

See the comments in the help for \code{\LinkA{detach}{detach}} about some
issues with unloading and reloading namespaces.
\end{Details}

\begin{Value}
\code{attachNamespace} returns invisibly the package environment it

see \LinkA{InternalMethods}{InternalMethods}.  It is \strong{not} the same as
\code{\LinkA{is.double}{is.double}}.  Factors are handled by the default method,
and there are methods for classes \code{"\LinkA{Date}{Date}"},
\code{"\LinkA{POSIXt}{POSIXt}"} and \code{"\LinkA{difftime}{difftime}"} (all of which
return false).  Methods for \code{is.numeric} should only return true
if the base type of the class is \code{double} or \code{integer}
\emph{and} values can reasonably be regarded as numeric
(e.g. arithmetic on them makes sense, and comparison should be done
via the base type).
\end{Details}

\begin{Value}
for \code{numeric} and \code{as.numeric} see \code{\LinkA{double}{double}}.

The default method for \code{is.numeric} returns \code{TRUE}
if its argument is of \LinkA{mode}{mode} \code{"numeric"}
(\LinkA{type}{type} \code{"double"} or type \code{"integer"}) and not a
factor, and \code{FALSE} otherwise.  That is,
\code{is.integer(x) || is.double(x)}, or
\code{(mode(x) == "numeric") \&\& !is.factor(x)}.

\begin{Section}{S4 methods}
\code{as.numeric} and \code{is.numeric} are internally S4 generic and
so methods can be set for them \emph{via} \code{setMethod}.

To ensure that \code{as.numeric}, \code{as.double} and \code{as.real}
remain identical, S4 methods can only be set for \code{as.numeric}.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Note on names}
It is a historical anomaly that \R{} has three names for its
floating-point vectors, \code{\LinkA{double}{double}}, \code{\LinkA{numeric}{numeric}}
and \code{\LinkA{real}{real}}.

\code{double} is the name of the \LinkA{type}{type}.
\code{numeric} is the name of the \LinkA{mode}{mode} and also of the implicit
\LinkA{class}{class}.  As an S4 formal class, use \code{"numeric"}.

\code{real} is deprecated and should not be used in new code.

The potential confusion is that \R{} has used \emph{\LinkA{mode}{mode}}
\code{"numeric"} to mean `double or integer', which conflicts
with the S4 usage.  Thus \code{is.numeric} tests the mode, not the
class, but \code{as.numeric} (which is identical to \code{as.double})
coerces to the class.

\begin{Description}\relax
How \R{} parses numeric constants.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\R{} parses numeric constants in its input in a very similar way to C99
floating-point constants.

\code{\LinkA{Inf}{Inf}} and \code{\LinkA{NaN}{NaN}} are numeric constants (with
\code{\LinkA{typeof}{typeof}(.) "double"}).  In text input (e.g. in
\code{\LinkA{scan}{scan}} and \code{\LinkA{as.double}{as.double}}), these are recognized
ignoring case as is \code{infinity} as an alternative to \code{Inf}.
\code{\LinkA{NA\_real\_}{NA.Rul.real.Rul.}} and \code{\LinkA{NA\_integer\_}{NA.Rul.integer.Rul.}} are constants of
types \code{"double"} and \code{"integer"} representing missing
values.  All other numeric constants start with a digit or period and
are either a decimal or hexadecimal constant optionally followed by
\code{L}.

Hexadecimal constants start with \code{0x} or \code{0X} followed by
a nonempty sequence from \code{0-9 a-f A-F .} which is interpreted as a
hexadecimal number, optionally followed by a binary exponent.  A binary
exponent consists of a \code{P} or \code{p} followed by an optional
plus or minus sign followed by a non-empty sequence of (decimal)
digits, and indicates multiplication by a power of two.  Thus
\code{0x123p456} is \eqn{291 \times 2^{456}}{}.

Decimal constants consist of a nonempty sequence of digits possibly
containing a period (the decimal point), optionally followed by a
decimal exponent.  A decimal exponent consists of an \code{E} or
\code{e} followed by an optional plus or minus sign followed by a
non-empty sequence of digits, and indicates multiplication by a power
of ten.

Values which are too large or too small to be representable will
overflow to \code{Inf} or underflow to \code{0.0}.

A numeric constant immediately followed by \code{i} is regarded as an
imaginary \LinkA{complex}{complex} number.

An numeric constant immediately followed by \code{L} is regarded as an
\code{\LinkA{integer}{integer}} number when possible (and with a warning if it
contains a \code{"."}).

Only the ASCII digits 0--9 are recognized as digits, even in languages
which have other representations of digits.  The `decimal
separator' is always a period and never a comma.

Note that a leading plus or minus is not regarded by the parser as
part of a numeric constant but as a unary operator applied to the constant.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
When a string is parsed to input a numeric constant, the number may or
may not be representable exactly in the C double type used.  If not
one of the nearest representable numbers will be returned.

\R{}'s own C code is used to convert constants to binary numbers, so the
effect can be expected to be the same on all platforms implementing
full IEC 600559 arithmetic (the most likely area of difference being
the handling of numbers less than \code{\LinkA{.Machine}{.Machine}\$double.xmin}).
The same code is used by \code{\LinkA{scan}{scan}}.

including package versions, and associated methods.

\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
numeric_version(x, strict = TRUE)
package_version(x, strict = TRUE)
R_system_version(x, strict = TRUE)
getRversion()
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] a character vector with suitable numeric version strings (see
`Details'); for \code{package\_version}, alternatively an R
version object as obtained by \code{\LinkA{R.version}{R.version}}.
\item[\code{strict}] a logical indicating whether invalid numeric versions
should results in an error (default) or not.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
Numeric versions are sequences of one or more non-negative integers,
usually (e.g., in package \file{DESCRIPTION} files) represented as
character strings with the elements of the sequence concatenated and
separated by single \samp{.} or \samp{-} characters.  \R{} package
versions consist of at least two such integers, an \R{} system version
of exactly three (major, minor and patchlevel).

Functions \code{numeric\_version}, \code{package\_version} and
\code{R\_system\_version} create a representation from such strings (if
suitable) which allows for coercion and testing, combination,
comparison, summaries (min/max), inclusion in data frames,
subscripting, and printing.  The classes can hold a vector of such
representations.

\code{getRversion} returns the version of the running \R{} as an R
system version object.

The \code{[[} operator extracts or replaces a single version.  To
access the integers of a version use two indices: see the examples.

%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] An object, for the methods inheriting from class \code{"octmode"}.
\item[\code{width}] \code{NULL} or a positive integer specifying the minimum
field width to be used, with padding by leading zeroes.
\item[\code{...}] further arguments passed to or from other methods.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
Class \code{"octmode"} consists of integer vectors with that class
attribute, used merely to ensure that they are printed in octal
notation, specifically for Unix-like file permissions such as
\code{755}.  Subsetting (\code{\LinkA{[}{[}}) works too.

If \code{width = NULL} (the default), the output is padded with
leading zeroes to the smallest width needed for all the non-missing
elements.

\code{as.octmode} can convert integers (of \LinkA{type}{type} \code{"integer"} or
\code{"double"}) and character vectors whose elements contain only
digits \code{0-7} (or are \code{NA}) to class \code{"octmode"}.

There is a \code{\LinkA{!}{!}} method and \code{\LinkA{|}{|}}, \code{\LinkA{\&}{.Ramp.}} and
\code{\LinkA{xor}{xor}} methods: these recycle their arguments to the
length of the longer and then apply the operators bitwise to each
element.

\begin{Description}\relax
\code{on.exit} records the expression given as its argument as needing
to be executed when the current function exits (either naturally or as
the result of an error).  This is useful for resetting graphical
parameters or performing other cleanup actions.

If no expression is provided, i.e., the call is \code{on.exit()}, then
the current \code{on.exit} code is removed.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
on.exit(expr = NULL, add = FALSE)

%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{expr}] an expression to be executed.
\item[\code{add}] if TRUE, add \code{expr} to be executed after any previously
set expressions; otherwise (the default) \code{expr} will overwrite
any previously set expressions.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
Where \code{expr} was evaluated changed in \R{} 2.8.0, and the following
applies only to that and later versions.

The \code{expr} argument passed to \code{on.exit} is recorded without
evaluation.  If it is not subsequently removed/replaced by another
\code{on.exit} call in the same function, it is evaluated in the
evaluation frame of the function when it exits (including during
standard error handling).  Thus any functions or variables in the
expression will be looked for in the function and its environment at
the time of exit: to capture the current value in \code{expr} use
\code{\LinkA{substitute}{substitute}} or similar.

This is a `special' \LinkA{primitive}{primitive} function: it only
evaluates the argument \code{add}.

\begin{Section}{Options used in base \R{}}
\begin{description}

\item[\code{add.smooth}:] typically logical, defaulting to
\code{TRUE}.  Could also be set to an integer for specifying how
many (simulated) smooths should be added.  This is currently only
used by \code{\LinkA{plot.lm}{plot.lm}}.

\item[\code{browserNLdisabled}:] logical: whether newline is
disabled as a synonym for \code{"n"} is the browser.

\item[\code{checkPackageLicense}:] logical, not set by default.  If
true, \code{\LinkA{library}{library}} asks a user to accept any non-standard
license at first use.


\item[\code{check.bounds}:] logical, defaulting to \code{FALSE}.  If
true, a \LinkA{warning}{warning} is produced whenever a
vector (atomic or \code{\LinkA{list}{list}}) is extended, by something
like \code{x <- 1:3; x[5] <- 6}.

\item[\code{continue}:] a non-empty string setting the prompt used
for lines which continue over one line.


\item[\code{defaultPackages}:] the packages that are attached by
default when \R{} starts up.  Initially set from value of the
environment variable \env{R\_DEFAULT\_PACKAGES}, or if that is unset
to \code{c("datasets", "utils", "grDevices", "graphics", "stats",
        "methods")}.  (Set \env{R\_DEFAULT\_PACKAGES} to \code{NULL} or
a comma-separated list of package names.)   A call to
\code{options} should be in your \file{.Rprofile} file to ensure
that the change takes effect before the base package is
initialized (see \code{\LinkA{Startup}{Startup}}).

\item[\code{deparse.max.lines}:] controls the number of lines used
when deparsing in \code{\LinkA{traceback}{traceback}}, \code{\LinkA{browser}{browser}},
and upon entry to a function whose debugging flag is set.
Initially unset, and only used if set to a positive integer.

\item[\code{digits}:] controls the number of digits to print when
printing numeric values.  It is a suggestion only.  Valid values
are 1\dots22 with default 7.  See the note in
\code{\LinkA{print.default}{print.default}} about values greater than 15.

\item[\code{digits.secs}:] controls the maximum number of digits to
print when formatting time values in seconds.  Valid values
are 0\dots6 with default 0.  See \code{\LinkA{strftime}{strftime}}.

\item[\code{download.file.extra}:] Extra command-line argument(s) for
non-default methods: see \code{\LinkA{download.file}{download.file}}.

\item[\code{download.file.method}:] Method to be used for
\code{download.file}.  Currently download methods
\code{"internal"}, \code{"wget"} and \code{"lynx"} are available.
There is no default for this option, when \code{method = "auto"}
is chosen: see \code{\LinkA{download.file}{download.file}}.

\item[\code{echo}:] logical.  Only used in non-interactive mode,
when it controls whether input is echoed.  Command-line option
\option{--slave} sets this to \code{FALSE}, but otherwise
it starts the session as \code{TRUE}.

\item[\code{encoding}:] The name of an encoding, default
\code{"native.enc"}.  See \code{\LinkA{connections}{connections}}.

\item[\code{error}:] either a function or an expression governing
the handling of non-catastrophic errors such as those generated by
\code{\LinkA{stop}{stop}} as well as by signals and internally detected
errors.  If the option is a function, a call to that function,
with no arguments, is generated as the expression.  The default
value is \code{NULL}: see \code{\LinkA{stop}{stop}} for the behaviour in
that case.  The functions \code{\LinkA{dump.frames}{dump.frames}} and
\code{\LinkA{recover}{recover}} provide alternatives that allow post-mortem
debugging.  Note that these need to specified as e.g.
\code{options(error=utils::recover)} in startup files such as
\file{\LinkA{.Rprofile}{.Rprofile}}.

\item[\code{expressions}:] sets a limit on the number of nested
expressions that will be evaluated.  Valid values are
25\dots500000 with default 5000.  If you increase it, you may
also want to start \R{} with a larger protection stack;
see \option{--max-ppsize} in \code{\LinkA{Memory}{Memory}}.  Note too that
you may cause a segfault from overflow of the C stack, and on OSes
where it is possible you may want to increase that.

\item[\code{keep.source}:] When \code{TRUE}, the source code for
functions (newly defined or loaded) is stored internally
allowing comments to be kept in the right places.  Retrieve the
source by printing or using \code{deparse(fn, control =
      "useSource")}.

The default is \code{\LinkA{interactive}{interactive}()}, i.e., \code{TRUE} for
interactive use.


\item[\code{keep.source.pkgs}:] As for \code{keep.source}, used only
when packages are installed.  Defaults to \code{FALSE} unless the
environment variable \env{R\_KEEP\_PKG\_SOURCE} is set to \code{yes}.

\item[\code{max.print}:] integer, defaulting to \code{99999}.
\code{\LinkA{print}{print}} or \code{\LinkA{show}{show}} methods can make use of
this option, to limit the amount of information that is printed,
to something in the order of (and typically slightly less than)
\code{max.print} \emph{entries}.

\item[\code{OutDec}:] character string containing a single-byte
character.  The character to be used as the decimal point in output
conversions, that is in printing, plotting and \code{as.character}
but not deparsing.

\item[\code{pager}:] the command used for displaying text files by
\code{\LinkA{file.show}{file.show}}.
Defaults to \code{"internal"}, which uses a pager similar to the
GUI console.  Another possibility is \code{"console"} to use the
console itself.
Can be a character string or an \R{} function, in which case it
needs to accept the arguments \code{(files, header,
	title, delete.file)} corresponding to the first four arguments of
\code{\LinkA{file.show}{file.show}}.

\item[\code{papersize}:] the default paper format used by
\code{\LinkA{postscript}{postscript}};  set by environment variable
\env{R\_PAPERSIZE} when \R{} is started: if that is unset or invalid
it defaults to
\code{"a4"}, or \code{"letter"} in US and Canadian locales.


\item[\code{pdfviewer}:] default PDF viewer.
The default is set from the environment variable \env{R\_PDFVIEWER},
which defaults to the full path to \command{open.exe}, a utility
supplied with \R{}.


\item[\code{printcmd}:] the command used by \code{\LinkA{postscript}{postscript}}
for printing; set by environment variable \env{R\_PRINTCMD} when
\R{} is started.  This should be a command that expects either input
to be piped to \file{stdin} or to be given a single filename
argument.  Usually set to \code{"lpr"} on a Unix-alike.

\item[\code{prompt}:] a non-empty string to be used for \R{}'s prompt;
should usually end in a blank (\code{" "}).



\item[\code{save.defaults}, \code{save.image.defaults}:] 
see \code{\LinkA{save}{save}}.

\item[\code{scipen}:] integer.  A penalty to be applied
when deciding to print numeric values in fixed or exponential
notation.  Positive values bias towards fixed and negative towards
scientific notation: fixed notation will be preferred unless it is
more than \code{scipen} digits wider.

\item[\code{showWarnCalls}, \code{showErrorCalls}:] a logical.
Should warning and error messages show a summary of the call
stack?  By default error calls are shown in non-interactive
sessions.

\item[\code{showNCalls}:] integer.  Controls how long the sequence
of calls must be (in bytes) before ellipses are used.  Defaults to
40 and should be at least 30 and no more than 500.

\item[\code{show.error.locations}:] Should source locations of
errors be printed?  If set to \code{TRUE} or \code{"top"}, the
source location that is highest on the stack (the most recent
call) will be printed.  \code{"bottom"} will print the location
of the earliest call found on the stack.

Integer values can select other entries.  The value \code{0}
corresponds to \code{"top"} and positive values count down the
stack from there.  The value \code{-1} corresponds to
\code{"bottom"} and negative values count up from there.  


\item[\code{show.error.messages}:] a logical.  Should error messages
be printed?  Intended for use with \code{\LinkA{try}{try}} or a
user-installed error handler.

\item[\code{stringsAsFactors}:] The default setting for arguments of
\code{\LinkA{data.frame}{data.frame}} and \code{\LinkA{read.table}{read.table}}.

\item[\code{texi2dvi}:] used by functions
\code{\LinkA{texi2dvi}{texi2dvi}} and \code{\LinkA{texi2pdf}{texi2pdf}} in package \pkg{tools}.


\item[\code{timeout}:] integer.  The timeout for some Internet
operations, in seconds.  Default 60 seconds.  See
\code{\LinkA{download.file}{download.file}} and \code{\LinkA{connections}{connections}}.

\item[\code{topLevelEnvironment}:] see \code{\LinkA{topenv}{topenv}} and
\code{\LinkA{sys.source}{sys.source}}.

\item[\code{useFancyQuotes}:] controls the use of
directional quotes in \code{\LinkA{sQuote}{sQuote}}, \code{dQuote} and in
rendering text help (see \code{\LinkA{Rd2txt}{Rd2txt}} in package
\pkg{tools}).  Can be \code{TRUE}, \code{FALSE}, \code{"TeX"} or
\code{"UTF-8"}.

\item[\code{verbose}:] logical.  Should \R{} report extra information
on progress?  Set to \code{TRUE} by the command-line option
\option{--verbose}.

\item[\code{warn}:] sets the handling of warning messages.  If
\code{warn} is negative all warnings are ignored.  If \code{warn}
is zero (the default) warnings are stored until the top--level
function returns.  If fewer than 10 warnings were signalled they
will be printed otherwise a message saying how many were
signalled.  An object called \code{last.warning} is
created and can be printed through the function
\code{\LinkA{warnings}{warnings}}.  If \code{warn} is one, warnings are
printed as they occur.  If \code{warn} is two or larger all
warnings are turned into errors.

\item[\code{warnPartialMatchArgs}:] logical.  If true, warns if
partial matching is used in argument matching.

\item[\code{warnPartialMatchAttr}:] logical.  If true, warns if
partial matching is used in extracting attributes via
\code{\LinkA{attr}{attr}}.

\item[\code{warnPartialMatchDollar}:] logical.  If true, warns if
partial matching is used for extraction by \code{\$}.

\item[\code{warning.expression}:] an \R{} code expression to be called
if a warning is generated, replacing the standard message.  If
non-null it is called irrespective of the value of option
\code{warn}.

\item[\code{warning.length}:] sets the truncation limit for error
and warning messages.  A non-negative integer, with allowed values
100\dots8170, default 1000.

\item[\code{nwarnings}:] the limit for the number of warnings kept
when \code{warn = 0}, default 50.  This will discard messages if
called whilst they are being collected.

\item[\code{width}:] controls the maximum number of columns on a
line used in printing vectors, matrices and arrays, and when
filling by \code{\LinkA{cat}{cat}}.

Columns are normally the same as characters except in CJK languages.

You may want to change this if you re-size the window that \R{} is
running in.  Valid values are 10\dots10000 with default normally
80.  (The limits on valid values are in file \file{Print.h} and can be
changed by re-compiling \R{}.)  Some \R{} consoles automatically change
the value when they are resized.

See the examples on \LinkA{Startup}{Startup} for one way to set this
automatically from the terminal width when \R{} is started.

\item[\code{device}:] a character string giving
the name of a function, or the function object itself,
which when called creates a new graphics device of the default
type for that session.  The value of this option defaults to the
normal screen device (e.g., \code{X11}, \code{windows} or
\code{quartz}) for an interactive session, and \code{pdf}
in batch use or if a screen is not available.  If set to the name
of a device, the device is looked for first from the global
environment (that is down the usual search path) and then in the
\pkg{grDevices} namespace.

The default values in interactive and non-interactive sessions are
configurable via environment variables
\env{R\_INTERACTIVE\_DEVICE} and \env{R\_DEFAULT\_DEVICE}
respectively.

Honoured at least on \code{X11} and \code{windows} devices.

\item[\code{windowsTimeout}:] (Windows-only) integer vector of length 2
representing two times in milliseconds.  These control the
double-buffering of \code{\LinkA{windows}{windows}} devices when that is
enabled: the first is the delay after plotting finishes
(default 100) and the second is the update interval during
continuous plotting (default 500).  The values at the time the
device is opened are used.

\item[\code{install.lock}:] logical: should per-directory package
locking be used by \code{\LinkA{install.packages}{install.packages}}?  Most useful
for binary installs on Mac OS X and Windows, but can be used in a
startup file for source installs \emph{via}
\command{R CMD \LinkA{INSTALL}{INSTALL}}.  For binary installs, can also be
the character string \code{"pkgloack"}.

\item[\code{internet.info}:] The minimum level of information to be
printed on URL downloads etc.  Default is 2, for failure causes.
Set to 1 or 0 to get more information.

\item[\code{mailer}:] default emailing method used by
\code{\LinkA{create.post}{create.post}} and hence \code{\LinkA{bug.report}{bug.report}} and
\code{\LinkA{help.request}{help.request}}.

\item[\code{menu.graphics}:] Logical: should graphical menus be used
if available?.  Defaults to \code{TRUE}.  Currently applies to

\item[\code{repos}:] URLs of the repositories for use by
\code{\LinkA{update.packages}{update.packages}}.  Defaults to
\code{c(CRAN="@CRAN@")}, a value that causes some utilities to
prompt for a CRAN mirror.  To avoid this do set the CRAN mirror,
by something like
\code{local(\{r <- getOption("repos"); r["CRAN"] <- "http://my.local.cran";
                   options(repos=r)\})}.

%
\begin{Description}\relax
\code{order} returns a permutation which rearranges its first
argument into ascending or descending order, breaking ties by further
arguments. \code{sort.list} is the same, using only one argument.\\{}
See the examples for how to use these functions to sort data frames,
etc.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
order(..., na.last = TRUE, decreasing = FALSE)

sort.list(x, partial = NULL, na.last = TRUE, decreasing = FALSE,
          method = c("shell", "quick", "radix"))
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{...}] a sequence of numeric, complex, character or logical
vectors, all of the same length, or a classed \R{} object.
\item[\code{x}] an atomic vector.
\item[\code{partial}] vector of indices for partial sorting.
(Non-\code{NULL} values are not implemented.)
\item[\code{decreasing}] logical.  Should the sort order be increasing or
decreasing?
\item[\code{na.last}] for controlling the treatment of \code{NA}s.
If \code{TRUE}, missing values in the data are put last; if
\code{FALSE}, they are put first; if \code{NA}, they are removed
(see `Note'.)
\item[\code{method}] the method to be used: partial matches are allowed.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
In the case of ties in the first vector, values in the second are used
to break the ties.  If the values are still tied, values in the later
arguments are used to break the tie (see the first example).
The sort used is \emph{stable} (except for \code{method = "quick"}),
so any unresolved ties will be left in their original ordering.

Complex values are sorted first by the real part, then the imaginary
part.

The sort order for character vectors will depend on the collating
sequence of the locale in use: see \code{\LinkA{Comparison}{Comparison}}.

The default method for \code{sort.list} is a good compromise.
Method \code{"quick"} is only supported for numeric \code{x} with
\code{na.last=NA}, and is not stable, but will be faster for long vectors.
Method \code{"radix"} is only implemented for integer \code{x} with
a range of less than 100,000.  For such \code{x} it is very
fast (and stable), and hence is ideal for sorting factors.

\code{partial = NULL} is supported for compatibility with other
implementations of S, but no other values are accepted and ordering is
always complete.

For a classed \R{} object, the sort order is taken from
\code{\LinkA{xtfrm}{xtfrm}}: as its help page notes, this can be slow unless a
suitable method has been defined or \code{\LinkA{is.numeric}{is.numeric}(x)} is
true.  For factors, this sorts on the internal codes, which is
particularly appropriate for ordered factors.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
\code{sort.list} can get called by mistake as a method for
\code{\LinkA{sort}{sort}} with a list argument, and gives a suitable error
message for list \code{x}.

There is a historical difference in behaviour for \code{na.last = NA}:
\code{sort.list} removes the \code{NA}s and then computes the order
amongst the remaining elements: \code{order} computes the order
amongst the non-\code{NA} elements of the original vector.  Thus
\begin{alltt}
   x[order(x, na.last = NA)]
   zz <- x[!is.na(x)]; zz[sort.list(x, na.last = NA)]
 \end{alltt}

both sort the non-\code{NA} values of \code{x}.

\begin{Description}\relax
The outer product of the arrays \code{X} and \code{Y} is the array
\code{A} with dimension \code{c(dim(X), dim(Y))} where element
\code{A[c(arrayindex.x, arrayindex.y)]
    = FUN(X[arrayindex.x], Y[arrayindex.y], ...)}.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
outer(X, Y, FUN="*", ...)
X %o% Y
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{X, Y}] First and second arguments for function \code{FUN}.
Typically a vector or array.
\item[\code{FUN}] a function to use on the outer products, found \emph{via}
\code{\LinkA{match.fun}{match.fun}} (except for the special case \code{"*"}).
\item[\code{...}] optional arguments to be passed to \code{FUN}.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{X} and \code{Y} must be suitable arguments for \code{FUN}.  Each
will be extended by \code{\LinkA{rep}{rep}} to length the products of the
lengths of \code{X} and \code{Y} before \code{FUN} is called.

\code{FUN} is called with these two extended vectors as
arguments. Therefore, it must be a vectorized function (or the
name of one), expecting at
least two arguments.

Where they exist, the [dim]names of \code{X} and \code{Y} will be
copied to the answer, and a dimension assigned which is the
concatenation of the dimensions of \code{X} and \code{Y} (or lengths
if dimensions do not exist).

\code{FUN = "*"} is handled internally as a special case, \emph{via}
\code{as.vector(X) \%*\% t(as.vector(Y))}, and is intended only for
numeric vectors and arrays.

\code{\%o\%} is binary operator providing a wrapper for
\code{outer(x, y, "*")}.

%
\begin{Description}\relax
\code{parse} returns the parsed but unevaluated expressions in a
list.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
parse(file = "", n = NULL, text = NULL, prompt = "?", srcfile,
      encoding = "unknown")
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{file}] a \LinkA{connection}{connection}, or a character string giving the name of a
file or a URL to read the expressions from.
If \code{file} is \code{""} and \code{text} is missing or \code{NULL}
then input is taken from the console.
\item[\code{n}] integer (or coerced to integer).  The maximum number of
expressions to parse.  If \code{n} is \code{NULL} or negative or
\code{NA} the input is parsed in its entirety.
\item[\code{text}] character vector.  The text to parse.  Elements are treated
as if they were lines of a file.  Other \R{} objects will be coerced
to character if possible.
\item[\code{prompt}] the prompt to print when parsing from the keyboard.
\code{NULL} means to use \R{}'s prompt, \code{getOption("prompt")}.
\item[\code{srcfile}] \code{NULL}, or a \code{\LinkA{srcfile}{srcfile}} object.  See
the `Details' section.
\item[\code{encoding}] encoding to be assumed for input strings.  If the
value is \code{"latin1"} or \code{"UTF-8"} it is used to mark
character strings as known to be in Latin-1 or UTF-8: it is not used
to re-encode the input.  To do the latter, specify the encoding as
part of the connection \code{con} or \emph{via}
\code{\LinkA{options}{options}(encoding=)}: see the example under
\code{\LinkA{file}{file}}.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
If \code{text} has length greater than zero (after coercion) it is used in
preference to \code{file}.

All versions of \R{} accept input from a connection with end of line
marked by LF (as used on Unix), CRLF (as used on DOS/Windows)
or CR (as used on classic Mac OS).  The final line can be incomplete,
that is missing the final EOL marker.

See \code{\LinkA{source}{source}} for the limits on the size of functions
that can be parsed (by default).

When input is taken from the console, \code{n = NULL} is equivalent to
\code{n = 1}, and \code{n < 0} will read until an EOF character is
read.  (The EOF character is Ctrl-Z for the Windows front-ends.)  The
line-length limit is 4095 bytes when reading from the console (which
may impose a lower limit: see `An Introduction to R').

The default for \code{srcfile} is set as follows.  If
\code{options("keep.source")} is \code{FALSE}, \code{srcfile}
defaults to \code{NULL}. Otherwise, if \code{text} is used,
\code{srcfile} will be set to a \code{\LinkA{srcfilecopy}{srcfilecopy}} containing
the text.  If a character string is used for \code{file}, a
\code{\LinkA{srcfile}{srcfile}} object referring to that file will be used.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
An object of type \code{"\LinkA{expression}{expression}"}, with up to \code{n}
elements if specified as a non-negative integer.

When \code{srcfile} is non-\code{NULL}, a \code{"srcref"} attribute
will be attached to the result containing a list of
\code{\LinkA{srcref}{srcref}} records corresponding to each element, a
\code{"srcfile"} attribute will be attached containing a copy of
\code{srcfile}, and a \code{"wholeSrcref"} attribute will be
attached containing a \code{\LinkA{srcref}{srcref}} record corresponding to
all of the parsed text.

A syntax error (including an incomplete expression) will throw an error.

Character strings in the result will have a declared encoding if
\code{encoding} is \code{"latin1"} or \code{"UTF-8"}, or if
\code{text} is supplied with every element of known encoding in a
Latin-1 or UTF-8 locale.

\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
paste (..., sep = " ", collapse = NULL)
paste0(..., collapse = NULL)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{...}] one or more \R{} objects, to be converted to character vectors.
\item[\code{sep}] a character string to separate the terms.  Not
\code{\LinkA{NA\_character\_}{NA.Rul.character.Rul.}}.
\item[\code{collapse}] an optional character string to separate the results.  Not
\code{\LinkA{NA\_character\_}{NA.Rul.character.Rul.}}.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{paste} converts its arguments (\emph{via}
\code{\LinkA{as.character}{as.character}}) to character strings, and concatenates
them (separating them by the string given by \code{sep}).  If the
arguments are vectors, they are concatenated term-by-term to give a
character vector result.  Vector arguments are recycled as needed,
with zero-length arguments being recycled to \code{""}.

Note that \code{paste()} coerces \code{\LinkA{NA\_character\_}{NA.Rul.character.Rul.}}, the
character missing value, to \code{"NA"} which may seem
undesirable, e.g., when pasting two character vectors, or very
desirable, e.g. in \code{paste("the value of p is ", p)}.

\code{paste0(..., collapse)} is equivalent to
\code{paste(..., sep = "", collapse)}, slightly more efficiently.

If a value is specified for \code{collapse}, the values in the result
are then concatenated into a single string, with the elements being
separated by the value of \code{collapse}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
A character vector of the concatenated values.  This will be of length
zero if all the objects are, unless \code{collapse} is non-NULL in
which case it is a single empty string.

If any input into an element of the result is in UTF-8 (and none are
declared with encoding \code{"bytes"}), that element will be in UTF-8,
otherwise in the current encoding in which case the encoding of the
element is declared if the current locale is either Latin-1 or UTF-8,
at least one of the corresponding inputs (including separators) had a
declared encoding and all inputs were either ASCII or declared.

If an input into an element is declared with encoding \code{"bytes"},
no translation will be done of any of the elements and the resulting
element will have encoding \code{"bytes"}.  If \code{collapse} is
non-NULL, this applies also to the second, collapsing, phase, but some
translation may have been done in pasting object together in the first
phase.

\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
pmatch(x, table, nomatch = NA_integer_, duplicates.ok = FALSE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] the values to be matched: converted to a character vector by
\code{\LinkA{as.character}{as.character}}.
\item[\code{table}] the values to be matched against: converted to a character
vector.
\item[\code{nomatch}] the value to be returned at non-matching or multiply
partially matching positions.  Note that it is coerced to \code{integer}.
\item[\code{duplicates.ok}] should elements be in \code{table} be used more
than once?
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The behaviour differs by the value of \code{duplicates.ok}. Consider
first the case if this is true.  First exact matches are considered,
and the positions of the first exact matches are recorded. Then unique
partial matches are considered, and if found recorded.  (A partial
match occurs if the whole of the element of \code{x} matches the
beginning of the element of \code{table}.)  Finally,
all remaining elements of \code{x} are regarded as unmatched.
In addition, an empty string can match nothing, not even an exact
match to an empty string.  This is the appropriate behaviour for
partial matching of character indices, for example.

If \code{duplicates.ok} is \code{FALSE}, values of \code{table} once
matched are excluded from the search for subsequent matches.  This
behaviour is equivalent to the \R{} algorithm for argument
matching, except for the consideration of empty strings (which in
argument matching are matched after exact and partial matching to any
remaining arguments).

\code{\LinkA{charmatch}{charmatch}} is similar to \code{pmatch} with
\code{duplicates.ok} true, the differences being that it
differentiates between no match and an ambiguous partial match,  it
does match empty strings, and it does not allow multiple exact matches.

\code{NA} values are treated as if they were the string constant
\code{"NA"}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
An integer vector (possibly including \code{NA} if \code{nomatch =
    NA}) of the same length as \code{x}, giving the indices of the
elements in \code{table} which matched, or \code{nomatch}.

\item[\code{x}] the object to be printed.
\item[\code{digits}] a non-null value for \code{digits} specifies the minimum
number of significant digits to be printed in values.  The default,
\code{NULL}, uses \code{\LinkA{getOption}{getOption}(digits)}.  (For the

\item[\code{quote}] logical, indicating whether or not strings
(\code{\LinkA{character}{character}}s) should be printed with surrounding quotes.
\item[\code{na.print}] a character string which is used to indicate
\code{\LinkA{NA}{NA}} values in printed output, or \code{NULL}
(see `Details').
\item[\code{print.gap}] a non-negative integer \eqn{\le 1024}{},
or \code{NULL} (meaning 1), giving the spacing between adjacent
columns in printed vectors, matrices and arrays.
\item[\code{right}] logical, indicating whether or not strings should be
right aligned.  The default is left alignment.
\item[\code{max}] a non-null value for \code{max} specifies the approximate
maximum number of entries to be printed.  The default, \code{NULL},
uses \code{\LinkA{getOption}{getOption}(max.print)}; see that help page for more
details.
\item[\code{useSource}] logical, indicating whether to use source
references or copies rather than deparsing language objects.
The default is to use the original source if it is available.
\item[\code{...}] further arguments to be passed to or from other
methods.  They are ignored in this function.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The default for printing \code{NA}s is to print \code{NA} (without
quotes) unless this is a character \code{NA} \emph{and} \code{quote =
    FALSE}, when \samp{<NA>} is printed.

The same number of decimal places is used throughout a vector.  This
means that \code{digits} specifies the minimum number of significant
digits to be used, and that at least one entry will be encoded with
that minimum number.  However, if all the encoded elements then have
trailing zeroes, the number of decimal places is reduced until at
least one element has a non-zero final digit.  Decimal points are only
included if at least one decimal place is selected.

Attributes are printed respecting their class(es), using the values of
\code{digits} to \code{print.default}, but using the default values
(for the methods called) of the other arguments.

When the \pkg{methods} package is attached, \code{print} will call
\code{\LinkA{show}{show}} for \R{} objects with formal classes if called
with no optional arguments.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Section}{Large number of digits}
Note that for large values of \code{digits}, currently for
\code{digits >= 16}, the calculation of the number of significant
digits will depend on the platform's internal (C library)
implementation of \samp{sprintf()} functionality.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Single-byte locales}
If a non-printable character is encountered during output, it is
represented as one of the ANSI escape sequences (\samp{\bsl{}a}, \samp{\bsl{}b},
\samp{\bsl{}f}, \samp{\bsl{}n}, \samp{\bsl{}r}, \samp{\bsl{}t}, \samp{\bsl{}v}, \samp{\bsl{}\bsl{}} and
\samp{\bsl{}0}: see \LinkA{Quotes}{Quotes}), or failing that as a 3-digit octal
code: for example the UK currency pound sign in the C locale (if
implemented correctly) is printed as \samp{\bsl{}243}.  Which characters
are non-printable depends on the locale.
(Because some versions of Windows get this wrong, all bytes with the
upper bit set are regarded as printable on Windows in a single-byte
locale.)
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Multi-byte locales}
In all locales, the characters in the ASCII range (\samp{0x00} to
\samp{0x7f}) are printed in the same way, as-is if printable, otherwise
via ANSI escape sequences or 3-digit octal escapes as described for
single-byte locales.

Multi-byte non-printing characters are printed as an escape sequence
of the form \samp{\bsl{}uxxxx} (in hexadecimal). This is the Unicode point
of the character.

It is possible to have a character string in a character vector that
is not valid in the current locale.  If a byte is encountered that is
not part of a valid character it is printed in hex in the form
\samp{\bsl{}xab} and this is repeated until the start of a valid character.

\code{proc.time} returns five elements for backwards compatibility,
but its \code{print} method prints a named vector of
length 3.  The first two entries are the total user and system CPU
times of the current \R{} process and any child processes on which it
has waited, and the third entry is the `real' elapsed time
since the process was started.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
An object of class \code{"proc\_time"} which is a numeric vector of
length 5, containing the user, system, and total elapsed times for the
currently running \R{} process, and the cumulative sum of user and
system times of any child processes spawned by it on which it has
waited.  (The \code{print} method combines the child times with those
of the main process.)

The definition of `user' and `system' times is from your
OS.  Typically it is something like

\emph{The `user time' is the CPU time charged for the execution
of user instructions of the calling process.  The `system time'
is the CPU time charged for execution by the system on behalf of the
calling process.}

Times of child processes are not available on Windows and will always
be given as \code{NA}.

The resolution of the times will be system-specific and on Unix-alikes
times are rounded down to milliseconds.  On modern systems they will
be that accurate, but on older systems they might be accurate to 1/100
or 1/60 sec.  They are typically available to 10ms on Windows.

Functions to push back text lines onto a \LinkA{connection}{connection}, and to enquire
how many lines are currently pushed back.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
pushBack(data, connection, newLine = TRUE)
pushBackLength(connection)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{data}] a character vector.
\item[\code{connection}] A \LinkA{connection}{connection}.
\item[\code{newLine}] logical.  If true, a newline is appended to each string
pushed back.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
Several character strings can be pushed back on one or more occasions.
The occasions form a stack, so the first line to be retrieved will be
the first string from the last call to \code{pushBack}.  Lines which
are pushed back are read prior to the normal input from the
connection, by the normal text-reading functions such as
\code{\LinkA{readLines}{readLines}} and \code{\LinkA{scan}{scan}}.

Pushback is only allowed for readable connections in text mode.

Not all uses of connections respect pushbacks, in particular the input
connection is still wired directly, so for example parsing
commands from the console and \code{\LinkA{scan}{scan}("")} ignore pushbacks on
\code{\LinkA{stdin}{stdin}}.

When character strings with a marked encoding (see
\code{\LinkA{Encoding}{Encoding}}) are pushed back they are converted to the
current encoding.  This may involve representing characters as
\samp{<U+xxxx>} if they cannot be converted.

\code{pushBack} returns nothing.

%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] a matrix whose QR decomposition is to be computed.
\item[\code{tol}] the tolerance for detecting linear dependencies in the
columns of \code{x}. Only used if \code{LAPACK} is false and
\code{x} is real.
\item[\code{qr}] a QR decomposition of the type computed by \code{qr}.
\item[\code{y, b}] a vector or matrix of right-hand sides of equations.
\item[\code{a}] a QR decomposition or (\code{qr.solve} only) a rectangular matrix.
\item[\code{k}] effective rank.
\item[\code{LAPACK}] logical.  For real \code{x}, if true use LAPACK
otherwise use LINPACK (the default).
\item[\code{...}] further arguments passed to or from other methods
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The QR decomposition plays an important role in many
statistical techniques.  In particular it can be used to solve the
equation \eqn{\bold{Ax} = \bold{b}}{} for given matrix \eqn{\bold{A}}{},
and vector \eqn{\bold{b}}{}.  It is useful for computing regression
coefficients and in applying the Newton-Raphson algorithm.

The functions \code{qr.coef}, \code{qr.resid}, and \code{qr.fitted}
return the coefficients, residuals and fitted values obtained when
fitting \code{y} to the matrix with QR decomposition \code{qr}.
(If pivoting is used, some of the coefficients will be \code{NA}.)
\code{qr.qy} and \code{qr.qty} return \code{Q \%*\% y} and
\code{t(Q) \%*\% y}, where \code{Q} is the (complete) \eqn{\bold{Q}}{} matrix.

All the above functions keep \code{dimnames} (and \code{names}) of
\code{x} and \code{y} if there are any.

\code{solve.qr} is the method for \code{\LinkA{solve}{solve}} for \code{qr} objects.
\code{qr.solve} solves systems of equations via the QR decomposition:
if \code{a} is a QR decomposition it is the same as \code{solve.qr},
but if \code{a} is a rectangular matrix the QR decomposition is
computed first.  Either will handle over- and under-determined
systems, providing a least-squares fit if appropriate.

\code{is.qr} returns \code{TRUE} if \code{x} is a \code{\LinkA{list}{list}}
with components named \code{qr}, \code{rank} and \code{qraux} and
\code{FALSE} otherwise.

It is not possible to coerce objects to mode \code{"qr"}.  Objects
either are QR decompositions or they are not.

\code{qr.fitted} and \code{qr.resid} only support the LINPACK interface.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
The QR decomposition of the matrix as computed by LINPACK or LAPACK.
The components in the returned value correspond directly
to the values returned by DQRDC/DGEQP3/ZGEQP3.
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{qr}] a matrix with the same dimensions as \code{x}.
The upper triangle contains the \eqn{\bold{R}}{} of the decomposition
and the lower triangle contains information on the \eqn{\bold{Q}}{} of
the decomposition (stored in compact form).  Note that the storage
used by DQRDC and DGEQP3 differs.
\item[\code{qraux}] a vector of length \code{ncol(x)} which contains
additional information on \eqn{\bold{Q}}{}.
\item[\code{rank}] the rank of \code{x} as computed by the decomposition:
always full rank in the LAPACK case.
\item[\code{pivot}] information on the pivoting strategy used during
the decomposition.

\end{ldescription}
Non-complex QR objects computed by LAPACK have the attribute
\code{"useLAPACK"} with value \code{TRUE}.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
To compute the determinant of a matrix (do you \emph{really} need it?),
the QR decomposition is much more efficient than using Eigen values
(\code{\LinkA{eigen}{eigen}}).  See \code{\LinkA{det}{det}}.

Using LAPACK (including in the complex case) uses column pivoting and
does not attempt to detect rank-deficient matrices.
\end{Note}

qr.X(qr, complete = FALSE, ncol =)
qr.Q(qr, complete = FALSE, Dvec =)

\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{qr}] object representing a QR decomposition.  This will
typically have come from a previous call to \code{\LinkA{qr}{qr}} or
\code{\LinkA{lsfit}{lsfit}}.
\item[\code{complete}] logical expression of length 1.  Indicates whether an
arbitrary  orthogonal completion of the \eqn{\bold{Q}}{} or
\eqn{\bold{X}}{} matrices is to be made, or whether the \eqn{\bold{R}}{}
matrix is to be completed  by binding zero-value rows beneath the
square upper triangle.
\item[\code{ncol}] integer in the range \code{1:nrow(qr\$qr)}.  The number
of columns to be in the reconstructed \eqn{\bold{X}}{}.  The default
when \code{complete} is \code{FALSE} is the first
\code{min(ncol(X), nrow(X))} columns of the original \eqn{\bold{X}}{}
from which the qr object was constructed.  The default when
\code{complete} is \code{TRUE} is a square matrix with the original
\eqn{\bold{X}}{} in the first \code{ncol(X)} columns and an arbitrary
orthogonal completion (unitary completion in the complex case) in
the remaining columns.
\item[\code{Dvec}] vector (not matrix) of diagonal values.  Each column of
the returned \eqn{\bold{Q}}{} will be multiplied by the corresponding
diagonal value.  Defaults to all \code{1}s.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{qr.X} returns \eqn{\bold{X}}{}, the original matrix from
which the qr object was constructed, provided \code{ncol(X) <= nrow(X)}.
If \code{complete} is \code{TRUE} or the argument \code{ncol} is greater than
\code{ncol(X)}, additional columns from an arbitrary orthogonal
(unitary) completion of \code{X} are returned.

\code{qr.Q} returns part or all of \bold{Q}, the order-nrow(X)
orthogonal (unitary) transformation represented by \code{qr}.  If
\code{complete} is \code{TRUE}, \bold{Q} has \code{nrow(X)} columns.
If \code{complete} is \code{FALSE}, \bold{Q} has \code{ncol(X)}
columns.  When \code{Dvec} is specified, each column of \bold{Q} is
multiplied by the corresponding value in \code{Dvec}.

\code{qr.R} returns \bold{R}.  This may be pivoted, e.g., if
\code{a <- qr(x)} then \code{x[, a\$pivot]} = \bold{QR}.  The number of
rows of \bold{R} is either \code{nrow(X)} or \code{ncol(X)} (and may
depend on whether \code{complete} is \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}).

   q(save = "default", status = 0, runLast = TRUE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{save}] a character string indicating whether the environment
(workspace) should be saved, one of \code{"no"}, \code{"yes"},
\code{"ask"} or \code{"default"}.
\item[\code{status}] the (numerical) error status to be returned to the
operating system, where relevant.  Conventionally \code{0}
indicates successful completion.
\item[\code{runLast}] should \code{.Last()} be executed?
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{save} must be one of \code{"no"}, \code{"yes"},
\code{"ask"} or \code{"default"}.  In the first case the workspace
is not saved, in the second it is saved and in the third the user is
prompted and can also decide \emph{not} to quit.  The default is to
ask in interactive use but may be overridden by command-line
arguments (which must be supplied in non-interactive use).

Immediately \emph{before} terminating, \code{.Last()} is executed if
the function \code{.Last} exists and \code{runLast} is true.  If in
interactive use there are errors in the \code{.Last} function,
control will be returned to the command prompt, so do test the
function thoroughly.  There is a system analogue,
\code{.Last.sys()}, which is run after \code{.Last()} if
\code{runLast} is true.

Exactly what happens at termination of an \R{} session depends on the
platform and GUI interface in use.  A typical sequence is to run
\code{.Last()} and \code{.Last.sys()} (unless \code{runLast} is
false), to save the workspace if requested (and in most cases also
to save the session history: see \code{\LinkA{savehistory}{savehistory}}), then
run any finalizers (see \code{\LinkA{reg.finalizer}{reg.finalizer}}) that have been
set to be run on exit, close all open graphics devices, remove the
session temporary directory and print any remaining warnings
(e.g. from \code{.Last()} and device closure).

Some error statuses are used by \R{} itself.  The default error
handler for non-interactive use effectively calls \code{q("no", 1,
      FALSE)} and returns error code 1.  Error status 2 is used for \R{}
`suicide', that is a catastrophic failure, and other small
numbers are used by specific ports for initialization failures.  It
is recommended that users choose statuses of 10 or more.

Valid values of \code{status} are system-dependent, but \code{0:255}
are normally valid.  (Many OSes will report the last byte of the
value, that is report the number modulo 256.  But not all.)



Windows calls the status the `error code' or `exit
code'.  It is returned in the environment variable
\env{\%ERRORLEVEL\%} in \code{cmd.exe}, and in \env{LASTEXITCODE}
in Windows PowerShell.  Note that the \code{Rterm} reliably reports
the \code{status} value, but \code{Rgui} may give an error code from
the GUI interface.

Descriptions of the various uses of quoting in \R{}.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
Three types of quotes are part of the syntax of \R{}: single and double
quotation marks and the backtick (or back quote, \samp{`}).  In
addition, backslash is used to escape the following character
inside character constants.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Section}{Character constants}
Single and double quotes delimit character constants.  They can be used
interchangeably but double quotes are preferred (and character
constants are printed using double quotes), so single quotes are
normally only used to delimit character constants containing double
quotes.

Backslash is used to start an escape sequence inside character
constants.  Escaping a character not in the following table is an
error.

Single quotes need to be escaped by backslash in single-quoted
strings, and double quotes in double-quoted strings.


\Tabular{ll}{
\samp{\bsl{}n}& newline\\{}
\samp{\bsl{}r}& carriage return\\{}
\samp{\bsl{}t}& tab\\{}
\samp{\bsl{}b}& backspace\\{}
\samp{\bsl{}a}& alert (bell)\\{}
\samp{\bsl{}f}& form feed\\{}
\samp{\bsl{}v}& vertical tab\\{}
\samp{\bsl{}\bsl{}}& backslash \samp{\bsl{}}\\{}
\samp{\bsl{}'}& ASCII apostrophe \samp{'}\\{}
\samp{\bsl{}"}& ASCII quotation mark \samp{"}\\{}
\samp{\bsl{}nnn}& character with given octal code (1, 2 or 3 digits)\\{}
\samp{\bsl{}xnn}& character with given hex code (1 or 2 hex digits)\\{}
\samp{\bsl{}unnnn}& Unicode character with given code (1--4 hex digits)\\{}
\samp{\bsl{}Unnnnnnnn}& Unicode character with given code (1--8 hex digits)\\{}
}
Alternative forms for the last two are \samp{\bsl{}u\{nnnn\}} and
\samp{\bsl{}U\{nnnnnnnn\}}.  All except the Unicode escape sequences are
also supported when reading character strings by \code{\LinkA{scan}{scan}}
and \code{\LinkA{read.table}{read.table}} if \code{allowEscapes = TRUE}.  Unicode
escapes can be used to enter Unicode characters not in the current
locale's charset (when the string will be stored internally in UTF-8).

The parser does not allow the use of both octal/hex and Unicode
escapes in a single string.

These forms will also be used by \code{\LinkA{print.default}{print.default}}
when outputting non-printable characters (including backslash).

Embedded nuls are not allowed in character strings, so using escapes
(such as \samp{\bsl{}0}) for a nul will result in the string being
truncated at that point (usually with a warning).
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Names and Identifiers}
Identifiers consist of a sequence of letters, digits, the period
(\code{.}) and the underscore.  They must not start with a digit nor
underscore, nor with a period followed by a digit.  \LinkA{Reserved}{Reserved}
words are not valid identifiers.

The definition of a \emph{letter} depends on the current locale, but
only ASCII digits are considered to be digits.

Such identifiers are also known as \emph{syntactic names} and may be used
directly in \R{} code.  Almost always, other names can be used
provided they are quoted.  The preferred quote is the backtick
(\samp{`}), and \code{\LinkA{deparse}{deparse}} will normally use it, but under
many circumstances single or double quotes can be used (as a character
constant will often be converted to a name).  One place where
backticks may be essential is to delimit variable names in formulae:
see \code{\LinkA{formula}{formula}}.

\begin{Description}\relax
\code{.Random.seed} is an integer vector, containing the random number
generator (RNG) \bold{state} for random number generation in \R{}.  It
can be saved and restored, but should not be altered by the user.

\code{RNGkind} is a more friendly interface to query or set the kind
of RNG in use.

\code{RNGversion} can be used to set the random generators as they
were in an earlier \R{} version (for reproducibility).

\code{set.seed} is the recommended way to specify seeds.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
.Random.seed <- c(rng.kind, n1, n2, ...)

RNGkind(kind = NULL, normal.kind = NULL)
RNGversion(vstr)
set.seed(seed, kind = NULL, normal.kind = NULL)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{kind}] character or \code{NULL}.  If \code{kind} is a character
string, set \R{}'s RNG to the kind desired.  Use \code{"default"} to
return to the \R{} default.  See `Details' for the
interpretation of \code{NULL}.
\item[\code{normal.kind}] character string or \code{NULL}.  If it is a character
string, set the method of Normal generation.  Use \code{"default"}
to return to the \R{} default.  \code{NULL} makes no change.
\item[\code{seed}] a single value, interpreted as an integer.
\item[\code{vstr}] a character string containing a version number,
e.g., \code{"1.6.2"}
\item[\code{rng.kind}] integer code in \code{0:k} for the above \code{kind}.
\item[\code{n1, n2, ...}] integers.  See the details for how many are required
(which depends on \code{rng.kind}).
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The currently available RNG kinds are given below.  \code{kind} is
partially matched to this list.  The default is
\code{"Mersenne-Twister"}.
\begin{description}

\item[\code{"Wichmann-Hill"}] 
The seed, \code{.Random.seed[-1] == r[1:3]} is an integer vector of
length 3, where each \code{r[i]} is in \code{1:(p[i] - 1)}, where
\code{p} is the length 3 vector of primes, \code{p = (30269, 30307,
      30323)}.
The Wichmann--Hill generator has a cycle length of
\eqn{6.9536 \times 10^{12}}{} (=
\code{prod(p-1)/4}, see \emph{Applied Statistics} (1984)
\bold{33}, 123 which corrects the original article).

\item[\code{"Marsaglia-Multicarry"}:] 
A \emph{multiply-with-carry} RNG is used, as recommended by George
Marsaglia in his post to the mailing list \file{sci.stat.math}.
It has a period of more than \eqn{2^{60}}{} and has passed
all tests (according to Marsaglia).  The seed is two integers (all
values allowed).

\item[\code{"Super-Duper"}:] 
Marsaglia's famous Super-Duper from the 70's.  This is the original
version which does \emph{not} pass the MTUPLE test of the Diehard
battery.  It has a period of \eqn{\approx 4.6\times 10^{18}}{} for most initial seeds.  The seed is two integers (all
values allowed for the first seed: the second must be odd).

We use the implementation by Reeds et al. (1982--84).

The two seeds are the Tausworthe and congruence long integers,
respectively.  A one-to-one mapping to S's \code{.Random.seed[1:12]}
is possible but we will not publish one, not least as this generator
is \bold{not} exactly the same as that in recent versions of S-PLUS.

\item[\code{"Mersenne-Twister":}] 
From Matsumoto and Nishimura (1998). A twisted GFSR with period
\eqn{2^{19937} - 1}{} and equidistribution in 623
consecutive dimensions (over the whole period).  The `seed' is a
624-dimensional set of 32-bit integers plus a current position in
that set.


\item[\code{"Knuth-TAOCP-2002":}] 
A 32-bit integer GFSR using lagged Fibonacci sequences with
subtraction.  That is, the recurrence used is
\deqn{X_j = (X_{j-100} - X_{j-37}) \bmod 2^{30}%
      }{}
and the `seed' is the set of the 100 last numbers (actually
recorded as 101 numbers, the last being a cyclic shift of the
buffer).  The period is around \eqn{2^{129}}{}.


\item[\code{"Knuth-TAOCP":}] 
An earlier version from Knuth (1997).

The 2002 version was not backwards compatible with the earlier
version: the initialization of the GFSR from the seed was altered.
\R{} did not allow you to choose consecutive seeds, the reported
`weakness', and already scrambled the seeds.

Initialization of this generator is done in interpreted \R{} code
and so takes a short but noticeable time.

\item[\code{"L'Ecuyer-CMRG":}] 
A `combined multiple-recursive generator' from L'Ecuyer
(1999), each element of which is a feedback multiplicative
generator with three integer elements: thus the seed is a (signed)
integer vector of length 6. The period is around
\eqn{2^{191}}{}.

The 6 elements of the seed are internally regarded as 32-bit
unsigned integers.  Neither the first three nor the last three
should be all zero, and they are limited to less than
\code{4294967087} and \code{4294944443} respectively.

This is not particularly interesting of itself, but provides the
basis for the multiple streams used in package \pkg{parallel}.



\item[\code{"user-supplied":}] 
Use a user-supplied generator.  See \code{\LinkA{Random.user}{Random.user}} for
details.


\end{description}


\code{normal.kind} can be \code{"Kinderman-Ramage"},
\code{"Buggy Kinderman-Ramage"} (not for \code{set.seed}),
\code{"Ahrens-Dieter"}, \code{"Box-Muller"}, \code{"Inversion"} (the
default), or \code{"user-supplied"}.  (For inversion, see the
reference in \code{\LinkA{qnorm}{qnorm}}.)  The Kinderman-Ramage generator
used in versions prior to 1.7.1 (now called \code{"Buggy"}) had several
approximation errors and should only be used for reproduction of old
results.  The \code{"Box-Muller"} generator is stateful as pairs of
normals are generated and returned sequentially.  The state is reset
whenever it is selected (even if it is the current normal generator)
and when \code{kind} is changed.

\code{set.seed} uses its single integer argument to set as many seeds
as are required.  It is intended as a simple way to get quite different
seeds by specifying small integer arguments, and also as a way to get
valid seed sets for the more complicated methods (especially
\code{"Mersenne-Twister"} and \code{"Knuth-TAOCP"}).  There is no
guarantee that different values of \code{seed} will seed the RNG
differently, although any exceptions would be extremely rare.

The use of \code{kind = NULL} or \code{normal.kind = NULL} in
\code{RNGkind} or \code{set.seed} selects the currently-used
generator (including that used in the previous session if the
workspace has been restored): if no generator has been used it selects
\code{"default"}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{.Random.seed} is an \code{\LinkA{integer}{integer}} vector whose first
element \emph{codes} the kind of RNG and normal generator. The lowest
two decimal digits are in \code{0:(k-1)}
where \code{k} is the number of available RNGs.  The hundreds
represent the type of normal generator (starting at \code{0}).

In the underlying C, \code{.Random.seed[-1]} is \code{unsigned};
therefore in \R{} \code{.Random.seed[-1]} can be negative, due to
the representation of an unsigned integer by a signed integer.

\code{RNGkind} returns a two-element character vector of the RNG and
normal kinds selected \emph{before} the call, invisibly if either
argument is not \code{NULL}.  A type starts a session as the default,
and is selected either by a call to \code{RNGkind} or by setting
\code{.Random.seed} in the workspace.

\code{RNGversion} returns the same information as \code{RNGkind} about
the defaults in a specific \R{} version.

\code{set.seed} returns \code{NULL}, invisibly.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
Initially, there is no seed; a new one is created from the current
time (and since \R{} 2.14.0, the process ID) when one is required.
Hence different sessions will give different simulation results, by
default.  However, the seed might be restored from a previous session
if a previously saved workspace is restored.

\code{.Random.seed} saves the seed set for the uniform random-number
generator, at least for the system generators.  It does not
necessarily save the state of other generators, and in particular does
not save the state of the Box--Muller normal generator.  If you want
to reproduce work later, call \code{set.seed} (preferably with
explicit values for \code{kind} and \code{normal.kind}) rather than
set \code{.Random.seed}.

The object \code{.Random.seed} is only looked for in the user's
workspace.

Do not rely on randomness of low-order bits from RNGs.  Most of the
supplied uniform generators return 32-bit integer values that are
converted to doubles, so they take at most \eqn{2^{32}}{} distinct
values and long runs will return duplicated values (Wichmann-Hill is
the exception, and all give at least 30 varying bits.)

\begin{Description}\relax
Function \code{\LinkA{RNGkind}{RNGkind}} allows user-coded uniform and
normal random number generators to be supplied.  The details are given
here.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
A user-specified uniform RNG is called from entry points in
dynamically-loaded compiled code.  The user must supply the entry point
\code{user\_unif\_rand}, which takes no arguments and returns a
\emph{pointer to} a double. The example below will show the general
pattern.

Optionally, the user can supply the entry point \code{user\_unif\_init},
which is called with an \code{unsigned int} argument when
\code{\LinkA{RNGkind}{RNGkind}} (or \code{set.seed}) is called, and is intended
to be used to initialize the user's RNG code.  The argument is intended
to be used to set the `seeds'; it is the \code{seed} argument to
\code{set.seed} or an essentially random seed if \code{\LinkA{RNGkind}{RNGkind}}
is called.

If only these functions are supplied, no information about the
generator's state is recorded in \code{.Random.seed}.  Optionally,
functions \code{user\_unif\_nseed} and \code{user\_unif\_seedloc} can be
supplied which are called with no arguments and should return pointers
to the number of seeds and to an integer (specifically, \samp{Int32})
array of seeds.  Calls to \code{GetRNGstate} and \code{PutRNGstate}
will then copy this array to and from \code{.Random.seed}.

A user-specified normal RNG is specified by a single entry point
\code{user\_norm\_rand}, which takes no arguments and returns a
\emph{pointer to} a double.
\end{Details}

     ties.method = c("average", "first", "random", "max", "min"))
\end{verbatim}

%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] a numeric, complex, character or logical vector.
\item[\code{na.last}] for controlling the treatment of \code{\LinkA{NA}{NA}}s.
If \code{TRUE}, missing values in the data are put last; if
\code{FALSE}, they are put first; if \code{NA}, they are removed; if
\code{"keep"} they are kept with rank \code{NA}.
\item[\code{ties.method}] a character string specifying how ties are treated,
see `Details'; can be abbreviated.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
If all components are different (and no \code{NA}s), the ranks are
well defined, with values in \code{seq\_len(x)}.  With some values equal
(called `ties'), the argument \code{ties.method} determines the
result at the corresponding indices.  The \code{"first"} method results
in a permutation with increasing values at each index set of ties.
The \code{"random"} method puts these in random order whereas the
default, \code{"average"}, replaces them by their mean, and
\code{"max"} and \code{"min"} replaces them by their maximum and
minimum respectively, the latter being the typical sports
ranking.

\code{NA} values are never considered to be equal: for \code{na.last =
    TRUE} and \code{na.last = FALSE} they are given distinct ranks in
the order in which they occur in \code{x}.

\strong{NB}: \code{rank} is not itself generic but \code{\LinkA{xtfrm}{xtfrm}}
is, and \code{rank(xtfrm(x), ....)} will have the desired result if
there is a \code{xtfrm} method.  Otherwise, \code{rank} will make use
of \code{==}, \code{>} and \code{is.na} methods for classed objects,
possibly rather slowly.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
A numeric vector of the same length as \code{x} with names copied from
\code{x} (unless \code{na.last = NA}, when missing values are
removed).  The vector is of integer type unless \code{ties.method =
    "average"} when it is of double type (whether or not there are any ties).

\code{rapply} is a recursive version of \code{\LinkA{lapply}{lapply}}.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
rapply(object, f, classes = "ANY", deflt = NULL,
       how = c("unlist", "replace", "list"), ...)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{object}] A list.
\item[\code{f}] A function of a single argument.
\item[\code{classes}] A character vector of \code{\LinkA{class}{class}} names, or
\code{"ANY"} to match any class.
\item[\code{deflt}] The default result (not used if \code{how = "replace"}).
\item[\code{how}] A character string matching the three possibilities given:
see `Details'.
\item[\code{...}] additional arguments passed to the call to \code{f}.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
This function has two basic modes.  If \code{how = "replace"}, each
element of the list which is not itself a list and has a class
included in \code{classes} is replaced by the result of applying
\code{f} to the element.

If the mode is \code{how = "list"} or \code{how = "unlist"}, the list
is copied, all non-list elements which have a class included in
\code{classes} are replaced by the result of applying \code{f} to the
element and all others are replaced by \code{deflt}.  Finally, if
\code{how = "unlist"}, \code{unlist(recursive = TRUE)} is called on
the result.

The semantics differ in detail from \code{\LinkA{lapply}{lapply}}: in
particular the arguments are evaluated before calling the C code.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
If \code{how = "unlist"}, a vector, otherwise a list of similar
structure to \code{object}.

\item[\code{length}] desired length.
\item[\code{x}] object to be coerced.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The raw type is intended to hold raw bytes.  It is possible to extract
subsequences of bytes, and to replace elements (but only by elements
of a raw vector).  The relational operators (see \LinkA{Comparison}{Comparison})
work, as do the logical operators (see \LinkA{Logic}{Logic}) with a bitwise
interpretation.

A raw vector is printed with each byte separately represented as a
pair of hex digits.  If you want to see a character representation
(with escape sequences for non-printing characters) use
\code{\LinkA{rawToChar}{rawToChar}}.

Coercion to raw treats the input values as representing small
(decimal) integers, so the input is first coerced to integer, and then
values which are outside the range \code{[0 ... 255]} or are
\code{NA} are set to \code{0} (the \code{nul} byte).

\code{as.raw} and \code{is.raw} are \LinkA{primitive}{primitive} functions.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{raw} creates a raw vector of the specified length.
Each element of the vector is equal to \code{0}.
Raw vectors are used to store fixed-length sequences of bytes.

\code{as.raw} attempts to coerce its argument to be of raw
type.  The (elementwise) answer will be \code{0} unless the
coercion succeeds (or if the original value successfully coerces to 0).

\code{is.raw} returns true if and only if \code{typeof(x) == "raw"}.

%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{object}] character or raw vector.  A description of the connection. 
For an input this is an \R{} raw vector object, and for an output
connection the name for the connection.

\item[\code{open}] character.  Any of the standard connection open modes.
\item[\code{con}] An output raw connection.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
An input raw connection is opened and the raw vector is copied
at the time the connection object is created, and \code{close}
destroys the copy.

An output raw connection is opened and creates an \R{} raw vector
internally.  The raw vector can be retrieved \emph{via} 
\code{rawConnectionValue}.

If a connection is open for both input and output the initial raw
vector supplied is copied when the connections is open
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
For \code{rawConnection}, a connection object of class
\code{"rawConnection"} which inherits from class \code{"connection"}.

For \code{rawConnectionValue}, a raw vector.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
As output raw connections keep the internal raw vector up to date
call-by-call, they are relatively expensive to use (although
over-allocation is used), and it may be better to use an anonymous
\code{\LinkA{file}{file}()} connection to collect output.

On (rare) platforms where \code{vsnprintf} does not return the needed length
of output there is a 100,000 character limit on the length of line for
output connections: longer lines will be truncated with a warning.

%
\begin{Value}
\code{charToRaw} converts a length-one character string to raw bytes.
It does so without taking into account any declared encoding (see
\code{\LinkA{Encoding}{Encoding}}).

\code{rawToChar} converts raw bytes either to a single character
string or a character vector of single bytes (with \code{""} for
\code{0}).  (Note that a single character string could contain
embedded nuls; only trailing nulls are allowed and will be removed.)
In either case it is possible to create a result which is invalid in a
multibyte locale, e.g. one using UTF-8.

\code{rawShift(x,n)} shift the bits in \code{x} by \code{n} positions
to the right, see the argument \code{n}, above.

\code{rawToBits} returns a raw vector of 8 times the length of a raw
vector with entries 0 or 1.  \code{intToBits} returns a raw vector
of 32 times the length of an integer vector with entries 0 or 1.
(Non-integral numeric values are truncated to integers.) In
both cases the unpacking is least-significant bit first.

\code{packBits} packs its input (using only the lowest bit for raw or
integer vectors) least-significant bit first to a raw or integer vector.

\item[\code{con}] A \LinkA{connection}{connection} object or a character string naming a file or
a raw vector.
\item[\code{what}] Either an object whose mode will give the mode of the

\item[\code{n}] integer.  The (maximal) number of records to be
read.  You can use an over-estimate here, but not too large as
storage is reserved for \code{n} items.
\item[\code{size}] integer.  The number of bytes per element in the byte
stream.  The default, \code{NA\_integer\_}, uses the natural size.
Size changing is not supported for raw and complex vectors.
\item[\code{signed}] logical.  Only used for integers of sizes 1 and 2,
when it determines if the quantity on file
should be regarded as a signed or unsigned integer.
\item[\code{endian}] The endian-ness (\code{"big"} or \code{"little"} of the
target system for the file.  Using \code{"swap"} will force swapping
endian-ness.

\item[\code{useBytes}] See \code{\LinkA{writeLines}{writeLines}}.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
These functions are intended to be used with binary-mode connections.
If \code{con} is a character string, the functions call
\code{\LinkA{file}{file}} to obtain a binary-mode file connection which is
opened for the duration of the function call.

If the connection is open it is read/written from its current
position.  If it is not open, it is opened for the duration of the
call in an appropriate mode (binary read or write) and then closed
again.  An open connection must be in binary mode.

If \code{readBin} is called with \code{con} a raw vector, the data in
the vector is used as input.  If \code{writeBin} is called with
\code{con} a raw vector, it is just an indication that a raw vector
should be returned.

If \code{size} is specified and not the natural size of the object,
each element of the vector is coerced to an appropriate type before
being written or as it is read.  Possible sizes are 1, 2, 4 and
possibly 8 for integer or logical vectors, and 4, 8 and possibly 12/16
for numeric vectors.  (Note that coercion occurs as signed types
except if \code{signed = FALSE} when reading integers of sizes 1 and 2.)
Changing sizes is unlikely to preserve \code{NA}s, and the extended
precision sizes are unlikely to be portable across platforms.

\code{readBin} and \code{writeBin} read and write C-style
zero-terminated character strings.  Input strings are limited to 10000
characters.  \code{\LinkA{readChar}{readChar}} and \code{\LinkA{writeChar}{writeChar}} can
be used to read and write fixed-length strings.  No check is made that
the string is valid in the current locale.

Handling \R{}'s missing and special (\code{Inf}, \code{-Inf} and
\code{NaN}) values is discussed in the \emph{R Data Import/Export} manual.

Only \eqn{2^{31}-1}{} bytes can be written in a single
call (and that is the maximum capacity of a raw vector).
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
For \code{readBin}, a vector of appropriate mode and length the number of
items read (which might be less than \code{n}).

For \code{writeBin}, a raw vector (if \code{con} is a raw vector) or
invisibly \code{NULL}.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
Integer read/writes of size 8 will be available if either C type
\code{long} is of size 8 bytes or C type \code{long long} exists and
is of size 8 bytes.

Real read/writes of size \code{sizeof(long double)} (usually 12 or 16
bytes) will be available only if that type is available and different
from \code{double}.

If \code{readBin(what = character())} is used incorrectly on a file
which does not contain C-style character strings, warnings (usually
many) are given.  From a file or connection, the input will be broken
into pieces of length 10000 with any final part being discarded.

Using these functions on a text-mode connection may work but should
not be mixed with text-mode access to the connection, especially if
the connection was opened with an \code{encoding} argument.

%
\begin{Details}\relax
These functions complement \code{\LinkA{readBin}{readBin}} and
\code{\LinkA{writeBin}{writeBin}} which read and write C-style zero-terminated
character strings.  They are for strings of known length, and
can optionally write an end-of-string mark.  They are intended only
for character strings valid in the current locale.

These functions are intended to be used with binary-mode connections.
If \code{con} is a character string, the functions call
\code{\LinkA{file}{file}} to obtain a binary-mode file connection which is
opened for the duration of the function call.

If the connection is open it is read/written from its current
position.  If it is not open, it is opened for the duration of the
call in an appropriate mode (binary read or write) and then closed
again.  An open connection must be in binary mode.

If \code{readChar} is called with \code{con} a raw vector, the data in
the vector is used as input.  If \code{writeChar} is called with
\code{con} a raw vector, it is just an indication that a raw vector
should be returned.  

Character strings containing ASCII \code{nul}(s) will be read
correctly by \code{readChar} but truncated at the first
\code{nul} with a warning.

If the character length requested for \code{readChar} is longer than
the data available on the connection, what is available is
returned.  For \code{writeChar} if too many characters are requested
the output is zero-padded, with a warning.

Missing strings are written as \code{NA}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
For \code{readChar}, a character vector of length the number of
items read (which might be less than \code{length(nchars)}).

For \code{writeChar}, a raw vector (if \code{con} is a raw vector) or
invisibly \code{NULL}.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
Earlier versions of \R{} allowed embedded nul bytes within character
strings, but not \R{} >= 2.8.0.  \code{readChar} was commonly used to
read fixed-size zero-padded byte fields for which \code{readBin} was
unsuitable.  \code{readChar} can still be used for such fields if
there are no embedded nuls: otherwise \code{readBin(what="raw")}
provides an alternative.

\code{nchars} will be interpreted in bytes not characters in a
non-UTF-8 multi-byte locale, with a warning.

There is little validity checking of UTF-8 reads.

Using these functions on a text-mode connection may work but should
not be mixed with text-mode access to the connection, especially if
the connection was opened with an \code{encoding} argument.

\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{con}] a \LinkA{connection}{connection} object or a character string.
\item[\code{n}] integer.  The (maximal) number of lines to
read.  Negative values indicate that one should read up to the end of
input on the connection.
\item[\code{ok}] logical.  Is it OK to reach the end of the connection before
\code{n > 0} lines are read?  If not, an error will be generated.
\item[\code{warn}] logical.  Warn if a text file is missing a final EOL.
\item[\code{encoding}] encoding to be assumed for input strings.  It is
used to mark character strings as known to be in
Latin-1 or UTF-8: it is not used to re-encode the input.  To do the
latter, specify the encoding as part of the connection \code{con} or
via \code{\LinkA{options}{options}(encoding=)}: see the example under
\code{\LinkA{file}{file}}.
See also `Details'.

\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
If the \code{con} is a character string, the function calls
\code{\LinkA{file}{file}} to obtain a file connection which is opened for
the duration of the function call.  As from \R{} 2.10.0 this can be a
compressed file.

If the connection is open it is read from its current position.  If it
is not open, it is opened in \code{"rt"} mode for the duration of
the call and then closed again.

If the final line is incomplete (no final EOL marker) the behaviour
depends on whether the connection is blocking or not.  For a
non-blocking text-mode connection the incomplete line is pushed back,
silently.  For all other connections the line will be accepted, with a
warning. 

Whatever mode the connection is opened in, any of LF, CRLF or CR will
be accepted as the EOL marker for a line.

If \code{con} is a not-already-open \LinkA{connection}{connection} with a non-default
\code{encoding} argument, the text is converted to UTF-8 and declared
as such (and the \code{encoding} argument to \code{readLines} is ignored).
See the examples.

binary one is used.  See the comments in the help for \code{\LinkA{save}{save}}.
\item[\code{version}] the workspace format version to use.  \code{NULL}
specifies the current default version (2).  Versions prior to 2 are not
supported, so this will only be relevant when there are later versions.
\item[\code{compress}] a logical specifying whether saving to a named file is

\code{"bzip2"} or \code{"xz"} to indicate the type of compression to
be used.  Ignored if \code{file} is a connection.
\item[\code{refhook}] a hook function for handling reference objects.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
These functions provide the means to save a single \R{} object to a
connection (typically a file) and to restore the object, quite
possibly under a different name.  This differs from \code{\LinkA{save}{save}}
and \code{\LinkA{load}{load}}, which save and restore one or more named
objects into an environment.  They are widely used by \R{} itself, for
example to store metadata for a package and to store the
\code{\LinkA{help.search}{help.search}} databases: the \code{".rds"} file extension
is most often used.

Functions \code{\LinkA{serialize}{serialize}} and \code{\LinkA{unserialize}{unserialize}}
provide a slightly lower-level interface to serialization: objects
serialized to a connection by \code{serialize} can be read back by
\code{readRDS} and conversely.

All of these interfaces use the same serialization format, which has
been used since \R{} 1.4.0 (but extended from time to time as new
object types have been added to \R{}).  However, \code{save} writes a
single line header (typically \code{"RDXs\bsl{}n"}) before the
serialization of a single object (a pairlist of all the objects to be
saved). 

Compression is handled by the connection opened when \code{file} is a
file name, so is only possible when \code{file} is a connection if
handled by the connection.  So e.g. \code{\LinkA{url}{url}} connections will
needed to be wrapped in a call to \code{\LinkA{gzcon}{gzcon}}.

If a connection is supplied it will be opened (in binary mode) for the
duration of the function if not already open: if it is already open it
must be in binary mode for \code{saveRDS(ascii = FALSE)} (the
default).

This help page documents the regular expression patterns supported by

\begin{Details}\relax
A `regular expression' is a pattern that describes a set of
strings.  Two types of regular expressions are used in \R{},
\emph{extended} regular expressions (the default) and
\emph{Perl-like} regular expressions used by \code{perl = TRUE}.
There is a also \code{fixed = TRUE} which can be considered to use a
\emph{literal} regular expression.

Other functions which use regular expressions (often via the use of
\code{grep}) include \code{apropos}, \code{browseEnv},
\code{help.search}, \code{list.files} and \code{ls}.
These will all use \emph{extended} regular expressions.

Patterns are described here as they would be printed by \code{cat}:
(\emph{do remember that backslashes need to be doubled when entering \R{}
character strings}, e.g. from the keyboard).

Do not assume that long regular expressions will be accepted: the
POSIX standard only requires up to 256 \emph{bytes}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Section}{Extended Regular Expressions}
This section covers the regular expressions allowed in the default
mode of \code{grep}, \code{regexpr}, \code{gregexpr}, \code{sub},
\code{gsub} and \code{strsplit}.  They use an implementation of the
POSIX 1003.2 standard: that allows some scope for interpretation and
the interpretations here are those used as from \R{} 2.10.0.

Regular expressions are constructed analogously to arithmetic
expressions, by using various operators to combine smaller
expressions.  The whole expression matches zero or more characters
(read `character' as `byte' if \code{useBytes = TRUE}).

The fundamental building blocks are the regular expressions that match
a single character.  Most characters, including all letters and
digits, are regular expressions that match themselves.  Any
metacharacter with special meaning may be quoted by preceding it with
a backslash.  The metacharacters in EREs are \samp{. \bsl{}
  | ( ) [ \{ \textasciicircum{} \$ * + ?}, but note that whether these have a special
meaning depends on the context.

Escaping non-metacharacters with a backslash is
implementation-dependent.  The current implementation interprets
\samp{\bsl{}a} as \samp{BEL}, \samp{\bsl{}e} as \samp{ESC}, \samp{\bsl{}f} as
\samp{FF}, \samp{\bsl{}n} as \samp{LF}, \samp{\bsl{}r} as \samp{CR} and
\samp{\bsl{}t} as \samp{TAB}.  (Note that these will be interpreted by
\R{}'s parser in literal character strings.)

A \emph{character class} is a list of characters enclosed between
\samp{[} and \samp{]} which matches any single character in that list;
unless the first character of the list is the caret \samp{\textasciicircum{}}, when it
matches any character \emph{not} in the list.  For example, the
regular expression \samp{[0123456789]} matches any single digit, and
\samp{[\textasciicircum{}abc]} matches anything except the characters \samp{a},
\samp{b} or \samp{c}.  A range of characters may be specified by
giving the first and last characters, separated by a hyphen.  (Because
their interpretation is locale- and implementation-dependent, they are
best avoided.)  The only portable way to specify all ASCII letters is
to list them all as the character class\\{}
\samp{[ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz]}.\\{}
(The current implementation uses numerical order of the encoding: prior to
\R{} 2.10.0 locale-specific collation was used, and might be again.)

Certain named classes of characters are predefined.  Their
interpretation depends on the \emph{locale} (see \LinkA{locales}{locales}); the
interpretation below is that of the POSIX locale.

\begin{description}

\item[\samp{[:alnum:]}] Alphanumeric characters: \samp{[:alpha:]}
and \samp{[:digit:]}.

\item[\samp{[:alpha:]}] Alphabetic characters: \samp{[:lower:]} and
\samp{[:upper:]}.

\item[\samp{[:blank:]}] Blank characters: space and tab, and
possibly other locale-dependent characters such as non-breaking
space.

\item[\samp{[:cntrl:]}] 
Control characters.  In ASCII, these characters have octal codes
000 through 037, and 177 (\code{DEL}).  In another character set,
these are the equivalent characters, if any.

\item[\samp{[:digit:]}] Digits: \samp{0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9}.

\item[\samp{[:graph:]}] Graphical characters: \samp{[:alnum:]} and
\samp{[:punct:]}.

\item[\samp{[:lower:]}] Lower-case letters in the current locale.

\item[\samp{[:print:]}] 
Printable characters: \samp{[:alnum:]}, \samp{[:punct:]} and space.

\item[\samp{[:punct:]}] Punctuation characters:\\{}
\samp{! " \# \$ \% \& ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? @ [ \bsl{} ] \textasciicircum{} \_ ` \{ | \} \textasciitilde{}}.


\item[\samp{[:space:]}] 
Space characters: tab, newline, vertical tab, form feed, carriage
return, space and possibly other locale-dependent characters.

\item[\samp{[:upper:]}] Upper-case letters in the current locale.

\item[\samp{[:xdigit:]}] Hexadecimal digits:\\{}
\samp{0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F a b c d e f}.

\end{description}


For example, \samp{[[:alnum:]]} means \samp{[0-9A-Za-z]}, except the
latter depends upon the locale and the character encoding, whereas the
former is independent of locale and character set.  (Note that the
brackets in these class names are part of the symbolic names, and must
be included in addition to the brackets delimiting the bracket list.)
Most metacharacters lose their special meaning inside a character
class.  To include a literal \samp{]}, place it first in the list.
Similarly, to include a literal \samp{\textasciicircum{}}, place it anywhere but first.
Finally, to include a literal \samp{-}, place it first or last (or,
for \code{perl = TRUE} only, precede it by a backslash).  (Only
\samp{\textasciicircum{} - \bsl{} ]} are special inside character classes.)

The period \samp{.} matches any single character.  The symbol
\samp{\bsl{}w} matches a `word' character (a synonym for
\samp{[[:alnum:]\_]}) and \samp{\bsl{}W} is its negation.  Symbols
\samp{\bsl{}d}, \samp{\bsl{}s}, \samp{\bsl{}D} and \samp{\bsl{}S} denote the digit and
space classes and their negations.

The caret \samp{\textasciicircum{}} and the dollar sign \samp{\$} are metacharacters
that respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a
line.  The symbols \samp{\bsl{}<} and \samp{\bsl{}>} match the empty string at
the beginning and end of a word.  The symbol \samp{\bsl{}b} matches the
empty string at either edge of a word, and \samp{\bsl{}B} matches the
empty string provided it is not at an edge of a word.  (The
interpretation of `word' depends on the locale and
implementation.)

A regular expression may be followed by one of several repetition
quantifiers:
\begin{description}

\item[\samp{?}] The preceding item is optional and will be matched
at most once.

\item[\samp{*}] The preceding item will be matched zero or more
times.

\item[\samp{+}] The preceding item will be matched one or more
times.

\item[\samp{\{n\}}] The preceding item is matched exactly \code{n}
times.

\item[\samp{\{n,\}}] The preceding item is matched \code{n} or more
times.

\item[\samp{\{n,m\}}] The preceding item is matched at least \code{n}
times, but not more than \code{m} times.

\end{description}

By default repetition is greedy, so the maximal possible number of
repeats is used.  This can be changed to `minimal' by appending
\code{?} to the quantifier.  (There are further quantifiers that allow
approximate matching: see the TRE documentation.)

Regular expressions may be concatenated; the resulting regular
expression matches any string formed by concatenating the substrings
that match the concatenated subexpressions.

Two regular expressions may be joined by the infix operator \samp{|};
the resulting regular expression matches any string matching either
subexpression.   For example, \samp{abba|cde} matches either the
string \code{abba} or the string \code{cde}.  Note that alternation
does not work inside character classes, where \samp{|} has its literal
meaning.

Repetition takes precedence over concatenation, which in turn takes
precedence over alternation.  A whole subexpression may be enclosed in
parentheses to override these precedence rules.

The backreference \samp{\bsl{}N}, where \samp{N = 1 ... 9}, matches
the substring previously matched by the Nth parenthesized
subexpression of the regular expression.  (This is an
extension for extended regular expressions: POSIX defines them only
for basic ones.)

\begin{Section}{Perl-like Regular Expressions}
The \code{perl = TRUE} argument to \code{grep}, \code{regexpr},
\code{gregexpr}, \code{sub}, \code{gsub} and \code{strsplit} switches
to the PCRE library that implements regular expression pattern
matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5.10,
with just a few differences.

For complete details please consult the man pages for PCRE, especially
\command{man pcrepattern} and \command{man pcreapi}), on your system or from
the sources at \url{http://www.pcre.org}. If PCRE support was compiled
from the sources within \R{}, the PCRE version is 8.12 as described here.

Perl regular expressions can be computed byte-by-byte or
(UTF-8) character-by-character: the latter is used in all multibyte
locales and if any of the inputs are marked as UTF-8 (see
\code{\LinkA{Encoding}{Encoding}}).

All the regular expressions described for extended regular expressions
are accepted except \samp{\bsl{}<} and \samp{\bsl{}>}: in Perl all backslashed
metacharacters are alphanumeric and backslashed symbols always are
interpreted as a literal character. \samp{\{} is not special if it
would be the start of an invalid interval specification.  There can be
more than 9 backreferences (but the replacement in \code{\LinkA{sub}{sub}}
can only refer to the first 9).

Character ranges are interpreted in the numerical order of
the characters, either as bytes in a single-byte locale or as Unicode
points in UTF-8 mode.  So in either case \samp{[A-Za-z]} specifies
the set of ASCII letters.

In UTF-8 mode the named character classes only match ASCII characters:
see \samp{\bsl{}p} below for an alternative.

The construct \samp{(?...)} is used for Perl extensions in a variety
of ways depending on what immediately follows the \samp{?}.

Perl-like matching can work in several modes, set by the options
\samp{(?i)} (caseless, equivalent to Perl's \samp{/i}), \samp{(?m)}
(multiline, equivalent to Perl's \samp{/m}), \samp{(?s)} (single line,
so a dot matches all characters, even new lines: equivalent to Perl's
\samp{/s}) and \samp{(?x)} (extended, whitespace data characters are
ignored unless escaped and comments are allowed: equivalent to Perl's
\samp{/x}).  These can be concatenated, so for example, \samp{(?im)}
sets caseless multiline matching.  It is also possible to unset these
options by preceding the letter with a hyphen, and to combine setting
and unsetting such as \samp{(?im-sx)}.  These settings can be applied
within patterns, and then apply to the remainder of the pattern.
Additional options not in Perl include \samp{(?U)} to set
`ungreedy' mode (so matching is minimal unless \samp{?} is used
as part of the repetition quantifier, when it is greedy).  Initially
none of these options are set.

If you want to remove the special meaning from a sequence of
characters, you can do so by putting them between \samp{\bsl{}Q} and
\samp{\bsl{}E}. This is different from Perl in that \samp{\$} and \samp{@} are
handled as literals in \samp{\bsl{}Q...\bsl{}E} sequences in PCRE, whereas in
Perl, \samp{\$} and \samp{@} cause variable interpolation.

The escape sequences \samp{\bsl{}d}, \samp{\bsl{}s} and \samp{\bsl{}w} represent
any decimal digit, space character and `word' character
(letter, digit or underscore in the current locale: in UTF-8 mode only
ASCII letters and digits are considered) respectively, and their
upper-case versions represent their negation.  Unlike POSIX, vertical
tab is not regarded as a space character.  Sequences \samp{\bsl{}h},
\samp{\bsl{}v}, \samp{\bsl{}H} and \samp{\bsl{}V} match horizontal and vertical
space or the negation.  (In UTF-8 mode, these do match non-ASCII
Unicode points.)

There are additional escape sequences: \samp{\bsl{}cx} is
\samp{cntrl-x} for any \samp{x}, \samp{\bsl{}ddd} is the
octal character (for up to three digits unless
interpretable as a backreference, as \samp{\bsl{}1} to \samp{\bsl{}7} always
are), and \samp{\bsl{}xhh} specifies a character by two hex digits.
In a UTF-8 locale, \samp{\bsl{}x\{h...\}} specifies a Unicode point
by one or more hex digits.  (Note that some of these will be
interpreted by \R{}'s parser in literal character strings.)

Outside a character class, \samp{\bsl{}A} matches at the start of a
subject (even in multiline mode, unlike \samp{\textasciicircum{}}), \samp{\bsl{}Z} matches
at the end of a subject or before a newline at the end, \samp{\bsl{}z}
matches only at end of a subject. and \samp{\bsl{}G} matches at first
matching position in a subject (which is subtly different from Perl's
end of the previous match).  \samp{\bsl{}C} matches a single
byte, including a newline, but its use is warned against.  In UTF-8
mode, \samp{\bsl{}R} matches any Unicode newline character (not just CR),
and \samp{\bsl{}X} matches any number of Unicode characters that form an
extended Unicode sequence.

In UTF-8 mode, some Unicode properties are supported via
\samp{\bsl{}p\{xx\}} and \samp{\bsl{}P\{xx\}} which match
characters with and without property \samp{xx} respectively.
For a list of supported properties see the PCRE documentation, but for
example \samp{Lu} is `upper case letter' and \samp{Sc} is
`currency symbol'.

The sequence \samp{(?\#} marks the start of a comment which continues
up to the next closing parenthesis.  Nested parentheses are not
permitted.  The characters that make up a comment play no part at all in
the pattern matching.

If the extended option is set, an unescaped \samp{\#} character outside
a character class introduces a comment that continues up to the next
newline character in the pattern.

The pattern \samp{(?:...)} groups characters just as parentheses do
but does not make a backreference.

Patterns \samp{(?=...)} and \samp{(?!...)} are zero-width positive and
negative lookahead \emph{assertions}: they match if an attempt to
match the \code{...} forward from the current position would succeed
(or not), but use up no characters in the string being processed.
Patterns \samp{(?<=...)} and \samp{(?<!...)} are the lookbehind
equivalents: they do not allow repetition quantifiers nor \samp{\bsl{}C}
in \code{...}.

As from \R{} 2.14.0 \code{regexpr} and \code{gregexpr} support
`named capture'.  If groups are named, e.g.,
\code{"(?<first>[A-Z][a-z]+)"} then the positions of the matches are
also returned by name.  (Named backreferences are not supported by
\code{sub}.)

Atomic grouping, possessive qualifiers and conditional
and recursive patterns are not covered here.

%
\begin{Description}\relax
Extract or replace matched substrings from match data obtained by
\code{\LinkA{regexpr}{regexpr}}, \code{\LinkA{gregexpr}{gregexpr}} or
\code{\LinkA{regexec}{regexec}}.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
regmatches(x, m, invert = FALSE)
regmatches(x, m, invert = FALSE) <- value
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] a character vector
\item[\code{m}] an object with match data
\item[\code{invert}] a logical: if \code{TRUE}, extract the non-matched
substrings.
\item[\code{value}] an object with suitable replacement values for the
matched or non-matched substrings (see \code{Details}).
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
If \code{invert} is \code{TRUE} (default), \code{regmatches} extracts
the matched substrings as specified by the match data.  For vector
match data (as obtained from \code{\LinkA{regexpr}{regexpr}}), empty matches are
dropped; for list match data, empty matches give empty components
(zero-length character vectors).

If \code{invert} is \code{FALSE}, \code{regmatches} extracts the
non-matched substrings, i.e., the strings are split according to the
matches similar to \code{\LinkA{strsplit}{strsplit}} (for vector match data, at
most a single split is performed).

Note that the match data can be obtained from regular expression
matching on a modified version of \code{x} with the same numbers of
characters.

The replacement function can be used for replacing the matched or
non-matched substrings.  For vector match data, if \code{invert} is
\code{TRUE}, \code{value} should be a character vector with length the
number of matched elements in \code{m}.  Otherwise, it should be a
list of character vectors with the same length as \code{m}, each as
long as the number of replacements needed.  Replacement coerces values
to character or list and generously recycles values as needed.
Missing replacement values are not allowed.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
For \code{regmatches}, a character vector with the matched substrings
if \code{m} is a vector and \code{invert} is \code{FALSE}.  Otherwise,
a list with the matched or non-matched substrings.

For \code{regmatches<-}, the updated character vector.
\end{Value}

\begin{Examples}
\begin{ExampleCode}
x <- c("A and B", "A, B and C", "A, B, C and D", "foobar")

## Consider
x <- "John (fishing, hunting), Paul (hiking, biking)"
## Suppose we want to split at the comma (plus spaces) between the
## persons, but not at the commas in the parenthesized hobby lists.
## One idea is to "blank out" the parenthesized parts to match the
## parts to be used for splitting, and extract the persons as the

\HeaderA{remove}{Remove Objects from a Specified Environment}{remove}

%
\begin{Description}\relax
\code{remove} and \code{rm} can be used to remove objects.  These can
be specified successively as character strings, or in the character
vector \code{list}, or through a combination of both.  All objects
thus specified will be removed.

If \code{envir} is NULL then the currently active environment is
searched first.

If \code{inherits} is \code{TRUE} then parents of the supplied
directory are searched until a variable with the given name is
encountered.  A warning is printed for each variable that is not
found.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
remove(..., list = character(), pos = -1,
       envir = as.environment(pos), inherits = FALSE)

rm    (..., list = character(), pos = -1,
       envir = as.environment(pos), inherits = FALSE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{...}] the objects to be removed, as names (unquoted) or
character strings (quoted).
\item[\code{list}] a character vector naming objects to be removed.
\item[\code{pos}] where to do the removal.  By default, uses the
current environment.  See `details' for other possibilities.
\item[\code{envir}] the \code{\LinkA{environment}{environment}} to use.  See `details'.
\item[\code{inherits}] should the enclosing frames of the environment be
inspected?
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The \code{pos} argument can specify the  environment from which to remove
the objects in any of several ways:
as an integer (the position in the \code{\LinkA{search}{search}} list); as
the character string name of an element in the search list; or as an
\code{\LinkA{environment}{environment}} (including using \code{\LinkA{sys.frame}{sys.frame}} to
access the currently active function calls).
The \code{envir} argument is an alternative way to specify an
environment, but is primarily there for back compatibility.

It is not allowed to remove variables from the base environment and
base namespace, nor from any environment which is locked (see
\code{\LinkA{lockEnvironment}{lockEnvironment}}).

Earlier versions of \R{} incorrectly claimed that supplying a character
vector in \code{...} removed the objects named in the character
vector, but it removed the character vector.  Use the \code{list}
argument to specify objects \emph{via} a character vector.

\code{rep} replicates the values in \code{x}.  It is a generic
function, and the (internal) default method is described here.

\code{rep.int} is a faster simplified version for the most common case.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
rep(x, ...)

rep.int(x, times)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] a vector (of any mode including a list) or a factor or
(except for \code{rep.int}) a \code{POSIXct} or \code{POSIXlt} or
\code{date} object; or also, an S4 object containing a vector of the
above kind.
\item[\code{...}] further arguments to be passed to or from other methods.
For the internal default method these can include:
\begin{description}

\item[\code{times}] A integer vector giving the (non-negative) number of
times to repeat each element if of length \code{length(x)}, or to
repeat the whole vector if of length 1.  Negative or \code{NA}
values are an error.
\item[\code{length.out}] non-negative integer.  The desired length of the
output vector.  Other inputs will be coerced to an integer
vector and the first element taken.  Ignored if \code{NA} or invalid.
\item[\code{each}] non-negative integer.  Each element of \code{x}
is repeated \code{each} times.  Other inputs will be coerced to
an integer vector and the first element taken.  Treated as
\code{1} if \code{NA} or invalid.

\end{description}


\item[\code{times}] see \code{...}.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The default behaviour is as if the call was \code{rep(x, times = 1,
    length.out = NA, each = 1)}.  Normally just one of the additional
arguments is specified, but if \code{each} is specified with either
of the other two, its replication is performed first, and then that
implied by \code{times} or \code{length.out}.

If \code{times} consists of a single integer, the result consists of
the whole input repeated this many times.  If \code{times} is a
vector of the same length as \code{x} (after replication by
\code{each}), the result consists of \code{x[1]} repeated
\code{times[1]} times, \code{x[2]} repeated \code{times[2]} times and
so on.

\code{length.out} may be given in place of \code{times},
in which case \code{x} is repeated as many times as is
necessary to create a vector of this length.  If both are given,
\code{length.out} takes priority and \code{times} is ignored.

Non-integer values of \code{times} will be truncated towards zero.
If \code{times} is a computed quantity it is prudent to add a small fuzz.

If \code{x} has length zero and \code{length.out} is supplied and is
positive, the values are filled in using the extraction rules, that is
by an \code{NA} of the appropriate class for an atomic vector
(\code{0} for raw vectors) and \code{NULL} for a list.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
An object of the same type as \code{x}.

\code{rep.int} returns no attributes (except the class if returning a
factor).

The default method of \code{rep} gives the result names (which will
almost always contain duplicates) if \code{x} had names, but retains
no other attributes.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
Function \code{rep.int} is a simple case handled by internal code, and
provided as a separate function partly for S compatibility and partly
for speed (especially when names can be dropped).

Function \code{rep} is a primitive, but (partial) matching of argument
names is performed as for normal functions.  You can no longer pass a
missing argument to e.g. \code{length.out}.

For historical reasons \code{rep} works on \code{NULL}: the result is
always \code{NULL} even when \code{length.out} is positive.

\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] a numeric vector.  Or, for \code{round} and \code{signif}, a
complex vector.

\item[\code{digits}] integer indicating the number of decimal places
(\code{round}) or significant digits (\code{signif}) to be used.
Negative values are allowed (see `Details').

\item[\code{...}] arguments to be passed to methods.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
These are generic functions: methods can be defined for them
individually or via the \code{\LinkA{Math}{S3groupGeneric}} group
generic.

Note that for rounding off a 5, the IEC 60559 standard is expected to
be used, `\emph{go to the even digit}'.
Therefore \code{round(0.5)} is \code{0} and \code{round(-1.5)} is
\code{-2}.  However, this is dependent on OS services and on
representation error (since e.g. \code{0.15} is not represented
exactly, the rounding rule applies to the represented number and not
to the printed number, and so \code{round(0.15, 1)} could be either
\code{0.1} or \code{0.2}).

Rounding to a negative number of digits means rounding to a power of
ten, so for example \code{round(x, digits = -2)} rounds to the nearest
hundred.

For \code{signif} the recognized values of \code{digits} are
\code{1...22}, and non-missing values are rounded to the nearest
integer in that range.  Complex numbers are rounded to retain the
specified number of digits in the larger of the components.  Each
element of the vector is rounded individually, unlike printing.

These are all primitive functions.

\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] a matrix-like \R{} object, with at least two dimensions for
\code{colnames}.
\item[\code{do.NULL}] logical. If \code{FALSE} and names are \code{NULL}, names are created.
\item[\code{prefix}] for created names.
\item[\code{value}] a valid value for that component of
\code{\LinkA{dimnames}{dimnames}(x)}.  For a matrix or array this is either
\code{NULL} or a character vector of non-zero length equal to the
appropriate dimension.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The extractor functions try to do something sensible for any
matrix-like object \code{x}.  If the object has \code{\LinkA{dimnames}{dimnames}}
the first component is used as the row names, and the second component
(if any) is used for the column names.  For a data frame, \code{rownames}
and \code{colnames} eventually call \code{\LinkA{row.names}{row.names}} and
\code{\LinkA{names}{names}} respectively, but the latter are preferred.

If \code{do.NULL} is \code{FALSE}, a character vector (of length
\code{\LinkA{NROW}{NROW}(x)} or \code{\LinkA{NCOL}{NCOL}(x)}) is returned in any
case, prepending \code{prefix} to simple numbers, if there are no
dimnames or the corresponding component of the dimnames is \code{NULL}.

The replacement methods for arrays/matrices coerce vector and factor
values of \code{value} to character, but do not dispatch methods for
\code{as.character}.

For a data frame, \code{value} for \code{rownames} should be a
character vector of non-duplicated and non-missing names (this is
enforced), and for \code{colnames} a character vector of (preferably)
unique syntactically-valid names.  In both cases, \code{value} will be
coerced by \code{\LinkA{as.character}{as.character}}, and setting \code{colnames}
will convert the row names to character.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
If the replacement versions are called on a matrix without any
existing dimnames, they will add suitable dimnames.  But
constructions such as
\begin{alltt}
    rownames(x)[3] <- "c"
\end{alltt}

may not work unless \code{x} already has dimnames, since this will
create a length-3 \code{value} from the \code{NULL} value of
\code{rownames(x)}.

number of rows of \code{x} with no duplicated nor missing values.
\code{NULL} is also allowed: see `Details'.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
A data frame has (by definition) a vector of \emph{row names} which
has length the number of rows in the data frame, and contains neither
missing nor duplicated values.  Where a row names sequence has been
added by the software to meet this requirement, they are regarded as
`automatic'.

Row names are currently allowed to be integer or character, but
for backwards compatibility (with \R{} <= 2.4.0) \code{row.names} will
always return a character vector.  (Use \code{attr(x, "row.names")} if
you need to retrieve an integer-valued set of row names.)

Using \code{NULL} for the value resets the row names to
\code{seq\_len(nrow(x))}, regarded as `automatic'.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{row.names} returns a character vector.

\code{row.names<-} returns a data frame with the row names changed.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
\code{row.names} is similar to \code{\LinkA{rownames}{rownames}} for arrays, and
it has a method that calls \code{rownames} for an array argument.

Row names of the form \code{1:n} for \code{n > 2} are stored
internally in a compact form, which might be seen from C code or by
deparsing but never via \code{row.names} or
\code{\LinkA{attr}{attr}(x, "row.names")}.  Additionally, some names of this
sort are marked as `automatic' and handled differently by
\code{\LinkA{as.matrix}{as.matrix}} and \code{\LinkA{data.matrix}{data.matrix}} (and potentially
other functions).  (All zero-row data frames are regarded as having
automatic row.names.)

\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] Either a vector of one or more elements from which to choose,
or a positive integer.  See `Details.'
\item[\code{n}] a positive number, the number of items to choose from.  See
`Details.'
\item[\code{size}] a non-negative integer giving the number of items to choose.
\item[\code{replace}] Should sampling be with replacement?
\item[\code{prob}] A vector of probability weights for obtaining the elements
of the vector being sampled.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
If \code{x} has length 1, is numeric (in the sense of
\code{\LinkA{is.numeric}{is.numeric}}) and \code{x >= 1}, sampling \emph{via}
\code{sample} takes place from \code{1:x}.  \emph{Note} that this
convenience feature may lead to undesired behaviour when \code{x} is
of varying length in calls such as \code{sample(x)}.  See the examples.

Otherwise \code{x} can be any \R{} object for which \code{length} and
subsetting by integers make sense: S3 or S4 methods for these
operations will be dispatched as appropriate.

For \code{sample} the default for \code{size} is the number of items
inferred from the first argument, so that \code{sample(x)} generates a
random permutation of the elements of \code{x} (or \code{1:x}).

As from \R{} 2.11.0 it is allowed to ask for \code{size = 0} samples
with \code{n = 0} or a length-zero \code{x}, but otherwise \code{n >
  0} or positive \code{length(x)} is required.

Non-integer positive numerical values of \code{n} or \code{x} will be
truncated to the next smallest integer, which has to be no larger than
\code{\LinkA{.Machine}{.Machine}\$integer.max}. 

The optional \code{prob} argument can be used to give a vector of
weights for obtaining the elements of the vector being sampled.  They
need not sum to one, but they should be non-negative and not all zero.
If \code{replace} is true, Walker's alias method (Ripley, 1987) is
used when there are more than 250 reasonably probable values: this
gives results incompatible with those from \R{} < 2.2.0, and there will
be a warning the first time this happens in a session.

If \code{replace} is false, these probabilities are applied
sequentially, that is the probability of choosing the next item is
proportional to the weights amongst the remaining items.  The number
of nonzero weights must be at least \code{size} in this case.

\code{sample.int} is a bare interface in which both \code{n} and
\code{size} must be supplied as integers.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
For \code{sample} a vector of length \code{size} with elements

\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
save(..., list = character(),
     file = stop("'file' must be specified"),
     ascii = FALSE, version = NULL, envir = parent.frame(),
     compress = !ascii, compression_level,
     eval.promises = TRUE, precheck = TRUE)

save.image(file = ".RData", version = NULL, ascii = FALSE,
           compress = !ascii, safe = TRUE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{...}] the names of the objects to be saved (as symbols or
character strings).
\item[\code{list}] A character vector containing the names of objects to be
saved.
\item[\code{file}] a (writable binary-mode) \LinkA{connection}{connection} or the name of the
file where the data will be saved (when \LinkA{tilde expansion}{tilde expansion}
is done).  Must be a file name for \code{version = 1}.
\item[\code{ascii}] if \code{TRUE}, an ASCII representation of the data is
written.  The default value of \code{ascii} is \code{FALSE} which
leads to a binary file being written.
\item[\code{version}] the workspace format version to use.  \code{NULL}
specifies the current default format.  The version used from \R{}
0.99.0 to \R{} 1.3.1 was version 1.  The default format as from \R{}
1.4.0 is version 2.
\item[\code{envir}] environment to search for objects to be saved.
\item[\code{compress}] logical or character string specifying whether saving
to a named file is to use compression.  \code{TRUE} corresponds to
\command{gzip} compression, and (from \R{} 2.10.0) character strings
\code{"gzip"}, \code{"bzip2"} or \code{"xz"} specify the
type of compression.  Ignored when \code{file} is a connection
and for workspace format version 1.
\item[\code{compression\_level}] integer: the level of compression to be
used.  Defaults to \code{6} for \command{gzip} compression and to
\code{9} for \command{bzip2} or \command{xz} compression.
\item[\code{eval.promises}] logical: should objects which are promises be
forced before saving?
\item[\code{precheck}] logical: should the existence of the objects be
checked before starting to save (and in particular before opening
the file/connection)?  Does not apply to version 1 saves.
\item[\code{safe}] logical.  If \code{TRUE}, a temporary file is used for
creating the saved workspace.  The temporary file is renamed to
\code{file} if the save succeeds.  This preserves an existing
workspace \code{file} if the save fails, but at the cost of using
extra disk space during the save.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The names of the objects specified either as symbols (or character
strings) in \code{...} or as a character vector in \code{list} are
used to look up the objects from environment \code{envir}.  By default
\LinkA{promises}{promises} are evaluated, but if \code{eval.promises = FALSE}
promises are saved (together with their evaluation environments).
(Promises embedded in objects are always saved unevaluated.)

All \R{} platforms use the XDR (bigendian) representation of C ints and
doubles in binary save-d files, and these are portable across all \R{}
platforms.  (ASCII saves used to be useful for moving data between
platforms but are now mainly of historical interest.  They can be more
compact than binary saves where compression is not used, but are
almost always slower to both read and write: binary saves compress
much better than ASCII ones.)

Default values for the \code{ascii}, \code{compress}, \code{safe} and
\code{version} arguments can be modified with the
\code{"save.defaults"} option (used both by \code{save} and
\code{save.image}), see also the `Examples' section.  If a
\code{"save.image.defaults"} option is set it is used in preference to
\code{"save.defaults"} for function \code{save.image} (which allows
this to have different defaults).

A connection that is not already open will be opened in mode
\code{"wb"}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Section}{Compression}
Large files can be reduced considerably in size by compression.  A
particular 46MB dataset was saved as 35MB without compression in 2
seconds, 22MB with \command{gzip} compression in 8 secs, 19MB with
\command{bzip2} compression in 13 secs and 9.4MB with \command{xz}
compression in 40 secs.  The load times were 1.3, 2.8, 5.5 and 5.7
seconds respectively.  These results are indicative, but the relative
performances do depend on the actual file and \command{xz} did
unusually well here.

It is possible to compress later (with \command{gzip}, \command{bzip2}
or \command{xz}) a file saved with \code{compress = FALSE}: the effect
is the same as saving with compression.  Also, a saved file can be
uncompressed and re-compressed under a different compression scheme
(and see \code{\LinkA{resaveRdaFiles}{resaveRdaFiles}} for a way to do so from within \R{}).
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Warnings}
The \code{...} arguments only give the \emph{names} of the objects
to be saved: they are searched for in the environment given by the
\code{envir} argument, and the actual objects given as arguments need
not be those found.

Saved \R{} objects are binary files, even those saved with
\code{ascii = TRUE}, so ensure that they are transferred without
conversion of end of line markers and of 8-bit characters.  The lines
are delimited by LF on all platforms.

Although the default version has not changed since \R{} 1.4.0, this
does not mean that saved files are necessarily backwards compatible.
You will be able to load a saved image into an earlier version of \R{}
unless use is made of later additions (for example, raw vectors or
external pointers).
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
The most common reason for failure is lack of write permission in the
current directory.  For \code{save.image} and for saving at the end of
a session this will shown by messages like
\begin{alltt}    Error in gzfile(file, "wb") : unable to open connection
    In addition: Warning message:
    In gzfile(file, "wb") :
      cannot open compressed file '.RDataTmp',
      probable reason 'Permission denied'
\end{alltt}


The defaults were changed to use compressed saves for \code{save} in
2.3.0 and for \code{save.image} in 2.4.0.  Any recent version of \R{}
can read compressed save files, and a compressed file can be
uncompressed (by \code{gzip -d}) for use with very old versions of \R{}.

\code{file} can be a UTF-8-encoded filepath that cannot be translated to
the current locale.

%
\begin{Description}\relax
\code{scale} is generic function whose default method centers and/or
scales the columns of a numeric matrix.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
scale(x, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] a numeric matrix(like object).
\item[\code{center}] either a logical value or a numeric vector of length
equal to the number of columns of \code{x}.
\item[\code{scale}] either a logical value or a numeric vector of length
equal to the number of columns of \code{x}.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The value of \code{center} determines how column centering is
performed.  If \code{center} is a numeric vector with length equal to
the number of columns of \code{x}, then each column of \code{x} has
the corresponding value from \code{center} subtracted from it.  If
\code{center} is \code{TRUE} then centering is done by subtracting the
column means (omitting \code{NA}s) of \code{x} from their
corresponding columns, and if \code{center} is \code{FALSE}, no
centering is done.

The value of \code{scale} determines how column scaling is performed
(after centering).  If \code{scale} is a numeric vector with length
equal to the number of columns of \code{x}, then each column of
\code{x} is divided by the corresponding value from \code{scale}.
If \code{scale} is \code{TRUE} then scaling is done by dividing the
(centered) columns of \code{x} by their standard deviations if
\code{center} is \code{TRUE}, and the root mean square otherwise.
If \code{scale} is \code{FALSE}, no scaling is done.

The root-mean-square for a (possibly centered) column is defined as
\eqn{\sqrt{\sum(x^2)/(n-1)}}{}, where \eqn{x}{} is
a vector of the non-missing values and \eqn{n}{} is the number of
non-missing values.  In the case \code{center=TRUE}, this is the
same as the standard deviation, but in general it is not.  (To scale
by the standard deviations without centering, use
\code{scale(x,center=FALSE,scale=apply(x,2,sd,na.rm=TRUE))}.)
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
For \code{scale.default}, the centered, scaled matrix.  The numeric
centering and scalings used (if any) are returned as attributes
\code{"scaled:center"} and \code{"scaled:scale"}

%
\begin{Description}\relax
Read data into a vector or list from the console or file.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
scan(file = "", what = double(), nmax = -1, n = -1, sep = "",
     quote = if(identical(sep, "\n")) "" else "'\"", dec = ".",
     skip = 0, nlines = 0, na.strings = "NA",
     flush = FALSE, fill = FALSE, strip.white = FALSE,
     quiet = FALSE, blank.lines.skip = TRUE, multi.line = TRUE,
     comment.char = "", allowEscapes = FALSE,
     fileEncoding = "", encoding = "unknown", text)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{file}] the name of a file to read data values from.  If the
specified file is \code{""}, then input is taken from the keyboard
(or whatever \code{\LinkA{stdin}{stdin}()} reads if input is redirected or
\R{} is embedded).
(In this case input can be terminated by a blank line or an EOF
signal, \samp{Ctrl-D} on Unix and \samp{Ctrl-Z} on Windows.)

Otherwise, the file name is interpreted \emph{relative} to the
current working directory (given by \code{\LinkA{getwd}{getwd}()}),
unless it specifies an \emph{absolute} path.
Tilde-expansion is performed where supported.
When running \R{} from a script, \code{file="stdin"} can be used to
refer to the process's \code{stdin} file stream.

As from \R{} 2.10.0 this can be a compressed file (see \code{\LinkA{file}{file}}).

Alternatively, \code{file} can be a \code{\LinkA{connection}{connection}},
which will be opened if necessary, and if so closed at the end of
the function call.  Whatever mode the connection is opened in,
any of LF, CRLF or CR will be accepted as the EOL marker for a line
and so will match \code{sep = "\bsl{}n"}.

\code{file} can also be a complete URL.  (For the supported URL
schemes, see the `URLs' section of the help for
\code{\LinkA{url}{url}}.)

To read a data file not in the current encoding (for example a
Latin-1 file in a UTF-8 locale or conversely) use a
\code{\LinkA{file}{file}} connection setting its \code{encoding} argument
(or \code{scan}'s \code{fileEncoding} argument).


\item[\code{what}] the type of \code{what} gives the type of data to be read.
The supported types are \code{logical}, \code{integer}, \code{numeric},
\code{complex}, \code{character}, \code{raw} and \code{\LinkA{list}{list}}.
If \code{what} is a list, it is assumed that the lines of the data file
are records each containing \code{length(what)} items
(`fields') and the list components should have elements which
are one of the first six types listed or \code{NULL}, see section
`Details' below.

\item[\code{nmax}] integer: the maximum number of data values to be read, or if
\code{what} is a list, the maximum number of records to be read.  If
omitted or not positive or an invalid value for an integer
(and \code{nlines} is not set to a positive value), \code{scan} will
read to the end of \code{file}.

\item[\code{n}] integer: the maximum number of data values to be read, defaulting to
no limit.  Invalid values will be ignored.

\item[\code{sep}] by default, scan expects to read `white-space'
delimited input fields.  Alternatively, \code{sep} can be used to
specify a character which delimits fields.  A field is always
delimited by an end-of-line marker unless it is quoted.

If specified this should be the empty character string (the default)
or \code{NULL} or a character string containing just one single-byte
character.


\item[\code{quote}] the set of quoting characters as a single character
string or \code{NULL}.  In a multibyte locale the quoting characters
must be ASCII (single-byte).

\item[\code{dec}] decimal point character.  This should be a character string
containing just one single-byte character.  (\code{NULL} and a
zero-length character vector are also accepted, and taken as the
default.)

\item[\code{skip}] the number of  lines of the input file to skip before
beginning to read data values.

\item[\code{nlines}] if positive, the maximum number of lines of data to be read.

\item[\code{na.strings}] character vector.  Elements of this vector are to be
interpreted as missing (\code{\LinkA{NA}{NA}}) values.  Blank fields are
also considered to be missing values in logical, integer, numeric
and complex fields.

\item[\code{flush}] logical: if \code{TRUE}, \code{scan} will flush to the
end of the line after reading the last of the fields requested.
This allows putting comments after the last field, but precludes
putting more that one record on a line.

\item[\code{fill}] logical: if \code{TRUE}, \code{scan} will implicitly add
empty fields to any lines with fewer fields than implied by
\code{what}.

\item[\code{strip.white}] vector of logical value(s) corresponding to items
in the \code{what} argument.  It is used only when \code{sep} has
been specified, and allows the stripping of leading and trailing
`white space' from \code{character} fields (\code{numeric} fields
are always stripped).  Note: white space inside quoted strings is
not stripped.

If \code{strip.white} is of length 1, it applies to all fields;
otherwise, if \code{strip.white[i]} is \code{TRUE} \emph{and} the
\code{i}-th field is of mode character (because \code{what[i]} is)
then the leading and trailing unquoted white space from field \code{i} is
stripped.


\item[\code{quiet}] logical: if \code{FALSE} (default), scan() will print a
line, saying how many items have been read.

\item[\code{blank.lines.skip}] logical: if \code{TRUE} blank lines in the
input are ignored, except when counting \code{skip} and \code{nlines}.

\item[\code{multi.line}] logical.  Only used if \code{what} is a list.  If
\code{FALSE}, all of a record must appear on one line (but more than
one record can appear on a single line).  Note that using \code{fill = TRUE}
implies that a record will be terminated at the end of a line.

\item[\code{comment.char}] character: a character vector of length one
containing a single character or an empty string.  Use \code{""} to
turn off the interpretation of comments altogether (the default).

\item[\code{allowEscapes}] logical.  Should C-style escapes such as
\samp{\bsl{}n} be processed (the default) or read verbatim?   Note that if
not within quotes these could be interpreted as a delimiter (but not
as a comment character).

The escapes which are interpreted are the control characters
\samp{\bsl{}a, \bsl{}b, \bsl{}f, \bsl{}n, \bsl{}r, \bsl{}t, \bsl{}v} and octal and
hexadecimal representations like \samp{\bsl{}040} and \samp{\bsl{}0x2A}.  Any
other escaped character is treated as itself, including backslash.
Note that Unicode escapes (starting \samp{\bsl{}u} or \samp{\bsl{}U}: see
\LinkA{Quotes}{Quotes}) are never processed.


\item[\code{fileEncoding}] character string: if non-empty declares the
encoding used on a file (not a connection nor the keyboard) so the
character data can be re-encoded.  See the `Encoding' section
of the help for \code{\LinkA{file}{file}}, and the `R Data
Import/Export Manual'.


\item[\code{encoding}] encoding to be assumed for input strings.  If the
value is \code{"latin1"} or \code{"UTF-8"} it is used to mark
character strings as known to be in Latin-1 or UTF-8: it is not used
to re-encode the input (see \code{fileEncoding}.  See also `Details'.


\item[\code{text}] character string: if \code{file} is not supplied and this is, 
then data are read from the value of \code{text} via a text connection.


\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The value of \code{what} can be a list of types, in which case
\code{scan} returns a list of vectors with the types given by the
types of the elements in \code{what}.  This provides a way of reading
columnar data.  If any of the types is \code{NULL}, the corresponding
field is skipped (but a \code{NULL} component appears in the result).

The type of \code{what} or its components can be one of the six
atomic vector types or \code{NULL} (see \code{\LinkA{is.atomic}{is.atomic}}).

`White space' is defined for the purposes of this function as
one or more contiguous characters from the set space, horizontal tab,
carriage return and line feed.  It does not include form feed or
vertical tab, but in Latin-1 and Windows 8-bit locales 'space'
includes non-breaking space.

Empty numeric fields are always regarded as missing values.
Empty character fields are scanned as empty character vectors, unless
\code{na.strings} contains \code{""} when they are regarded as missing
values.

The allowed input for a numeric field is optional whitespace followed
either \code{NA} or an optional sign followed by a decimal or
hexadecimal constant (see \LinkA{NumericConstants}{NumericConstants}), or \code{NaN},
\code{Inf} or \code{infinity} (ignoring case).  Out-of-range values
are recorded as \code{Inf}, \code{-Inf} or \code{0}.

For an integer field the allowed input is optional whitespace,
followed by either \code{NA} or an optional sign and one or more
digits (\samp{0-9}): all out-of-range values are converted to
\code{NA\_integer\_}.

If \code{sep} is the default (\code{""}), the character \samp{\bsl{}}
in a quoted string escapes the following character, so quotes may be
included in the string by escaping them.

If \code{sep} is non-default, the fields may be quoted in the style of
\file{.csv} files where separators inside quotes (\code{''} or
\code{""}) are ignored and quotes may be put inside strings by
doubling them.  However, if \code{sep = "\bsl{}n"} it is assumed
by default that one wants to read entire lines verbatim.

Quoting is only interpreted in character fields and in \code{NULL}
fields (which might be skipping character fields).

Note that since \code{sep} is a separator and not a terminator,
reading a file by \code{scan("foo", sep="\bsl{}n", blank.lines.skip=FALSE)}
will give an empty final line if the file ends in a linefeed and not if
it does not.  This might not be what you expected; see also
\code{\LinkA{readLines}{readLines}}.

If \code{comment.char} occurs (except inside a quoted character
field), it signals that the rest of the line should be regarded as a
comment and be discarded.  Lines beginning with a comment character
(possibly after white space with the default separator) are treated as
blank lines.

There is a line-length limit of 4095 bytes when reading from the
console (which may impose a lower limit: see `An Introduction
to R').

There is a check for a user interrupt every 1000 lines if \code{what}
is a list, otherwise every 10000 items.

If \code{file} is a character string and \code{fileEncoding} is
non-default, or it it is a not-already-open \LinkA{connection}{connection} with a
non-default \code{encoding} argument, the text is converted to UTF-8
and declared as such (and the \code{encoding} argument to \code{scan}
is ignored).  See the examples of \code{\LinkA{readLines}{readLines}}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
if \code{what} is a list, a list of the same length and same names (as
any) as \code{what}.

Otherwise, a vector of the type of \code{what}.

Character strings in the result will have a declared encoding if
\code{encoding} is \code{"latin1"} or \code{"UTF-8"}.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
The default for \code{multi.line} differs from S.  To read one record
per line, use \code{flush = TRUE} and \code{multi.line = FALSE}.
(Note that quoted character strings can still include embedded newlines.)

If number of items is not specified, the internal
mechanism re-allocates memory in powers of two and so could use up
to three times as much memory as needed.  (It needs both old and new
copies.)  If you can, specify either \code{n} or \code{nmax} whenever
inputting a large vector, and \code{nmax} or \code{nlines} when
inputting a large list.

Using \code{scan} on an open connection to read partial lines can lose
chars: use an explicit separator to avoid this.

Having \code{nul} bytes in fields (including \samp{\bsl{}0} if
\code{allowEscapes = TRUE}) may lead to interpretation of the
field being terminated at the \code{nul}.  They not normally present
in text files -- see \code{\LinkA{readBin}{readBin}}.

\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{con}] a \LinkA{connection}{connection}.
\item[\code{where}] numeric.  A file position (relative to the origin
specified by \code{origin}), or \code{NA}.
\item[\code{rw}] character.  Empty or \code{"read"} or \code{"write"},
partial matches allowed.
\item[\code{origin}] character.  One of \code{"start"}, \code{"current"},
\code{"end"}: see `Details'.
\item[\code{...}] further arguments passed to or from other methods.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{seek} with \code{where = NA} returns the current byte offset
of a connection (from the beginning), and with a non-missing \code{where}
argument the connection is re-positioned (if possible) to the
specified position.  \code{isSeekable} returns whether the connection
in principle supports \code{seek}: currently only (possibly
gz-compressed) file connections do.

\code{where} is stored as a real but should represent an integer:
non-integer values are likely to be truncated.  Note that the possible
values can exceed the largest representable number in an \R{}
\code{integer} on 64-bit builds, and on some 32-bit builds.

File connections can be open for both writing/appending, in which case
\R{} keeps separate positions for reading and writing.  Which \code{seek}
refers to can be set by its \code{rw} argument: the default is the
last mode (reading or writing) which was used.  Most files are
only opened for reading or writing and so default to that state.  If a
file is open for both reading and writing but has not been used, the
default is to give the reading position (0).

The initial file position for reading is always at the beginning.
The initial position for writing is at the beginning of the file
for modes \code{"r+"} and \code{"r+b"}, otherwise at the end of the
file.  Some platforms only allow writing at the end of the file in
the append modes.  (The reported write position for a file opened in
an append mode will typically be unreliable until the file has been
written to.)

\code{gzfile} connections support \code{seek} with a number of
limitations, using the file position of the uncompressed file.
They do not support \code{origin = "end"}.  When writing, seeking is
only possible forwards: when reading seeking backwards is supported by
rewinding the file and re-reading from its start.

If \code{seek} is called with a non-\code{NA} value of \code{where},
any pushback on a text-mode connection is discarded.

\code{truncate} truncates a file opened for writing at its current
position.  It works only for \code{file} connections, and is not
implemented on all platforms: on others (including Windows) it will
not work for large (> 2Gb) files.

None of these should be expected to work on text-mode connections with
re-encoding selected.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{seek} returns the current position (before any move), as a
(numeric) byte offset from the origin, if relevant, or \code{0} if
not.  Note that the position can exceed the largest representable
number in an \R{} \code{integer} on 64-bit builds, and on some 32-bit
builds.

\code{truncate} returns \code{NULL}: it stops with an error if
it fails (or is not implemented).

\code{isSeekable} returns a logical value, whether the connection
supports \code{seek}.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{Warning}
Use of \code{seek} on Windows is discouraged.  We have found so many
errors in the Windows implementation of file positioning that users
are advised to use it only at their own risk, and asked not to waste
the \R{} developers' time with bug reports on Windows' deficiencies.

\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{...}] arguments passed to or from methods.
\item[\code{from, to}] the starting and (maximal) end values of the
sequence.  Of length \code{1} unless just \code{from} is supplied as
an unnamed argument.
\item[\code{by}] number: increment of the sequence.
\item[\code{length.out}] desired length of the sequence.  A
non-negative number, which for \code{seq} and \code{seq.int} will be
rounded up if fractional.
\item[\code{along.with}] take the length from the length of this argument.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The interpretation of the unnamed arguments of \code{seq} and
\code{seq.int} is \emph{not} standard, and it is recommended always to
name the arguments when programming.

\code{seq} is  generic, and only the default method is described here.
Note that it dispatches on the class of the \strong{first} argument
irrespective of argument names.  This can have unintended consequences
if it is called with just one argument intending this to be taken as
\code{along.with}: it is much better to use \code{seg\_along} in that
case.

\code{seq.int} is an \LinkA{internal generic}{internal generic} which dispatches on
methods for \code{"seq"} based on the class of the first supplied
argument (before argument matching).

Typical usages are
\begin{alltt}seq(from, to)
seq(from, to, by= )
seq(from, to, length.out= )
seq(along.with= )
seq(from)
seq(length.out= )
\end{alltt}

The first form generates the sequence \code{from, from+/-1, ..., to}
(identical to \code{from:to}).

The second form generates \code{from, from+by}, \ldots, up to the
sequence value less than or equal to \code{to}.  Specifying \code{to -
  from} and \code{by} of opposite signs is an error.  Note that the
computed final value can go just beyond \code{to} to allow for
rounding error, but is truncated to \code{to}.  (`Just beyond'
is by up to \eqn{10^{-10}}{} times \code{abs(from - to)}.)

The third generates a sequence of \code{length.out} equally spaced
values from \code{from} to \code{to}.  (\code{length.out} is usually
abbreviated to \code{length} or \code{len}, and \code{seq\_len} is much
faster.)

The fourth form generates the integer sequence \code{1, 2, ...,
    length(along.with)}.  (\code{along.with} is usually abbreviated to
\code{along}, and \code{seq\_along} is much faster.)

The fifth form generates the sequence \code{1, 2, ..., length(from)}
(as if argument \code{along.with} had been specified), \emph{unless}
the argument is numeric of length 1 when it is interpreted as
\code{1:from} (even for \code{seq(0)} for compatibility with S).
Using either \code{seq\_along} or \code{seq\_len} is much preferred
(unless strict S compatibility is essential).

The final form generates the integer sequence \code{1, 2, ...,
  length.out} unless \code{length.out = 0}, when it generates
\code{integer(0)}.

Very small sequences (with \code{from - to} of the order of \eqn{10^{-14}}{}
times the larger of the ends) will return \code{from}.

For \code{seq} (only), up to two of \code{from}, \code{to} and
\code{by} can be supplied as complex values provided \code{length.out}
or \code{along.with} is specified.  More generally, the default method
of \code{seq} will handle classed objects with methods for
the \code{Math}, \code{Ops} and \code{Summary} group generics.

\code{seq.int}, \code{seq\_along} and \code{seq\_len} are
\LinkA{primitive}{primitive}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{seq.int} and the default method of \code{seq} for numeric
arguments return a vector of type \code{"integer"} or \code{"double"}:
programmers should not rely on which.

\code{seq\_along} and \code{seq\_len} always return an integer vector.

\code{by} can be specified in several ways.
\begin{itemize}

\item A number, taken to be in seconds.
\item A object of class \code{\LinkA{difftime}{difftime}}
\item A character string, containing one of \code{"sec"},
\code{"min"}, \code{"hour"}, \code{"day"}, \code{"DSTday"},
\code{"week"}, \code{"month"} or \code{"year"}.  This can optionally be
preceded by a (positive or negative) integer and a space,
or followed by \code{"s"}.

\end{itemize}

The difference between \code{"day"} and \code{"DSTday"} is that the
former ignores changes to/from daylight savings time and the latter takes
the same clock time each day.  (\code{"week"} ignores DST (it is a
period of 144 hours), but \code{"7 DSTdays"}) can be used as an
alternative.  \code{"month"} and \code{"year"} allow for DST.)

The \LinkA{timezone}{timezone} of the result is taken from \code{from}: remember
that GMT means UTC (and not the timezone of Greenwich, England) and so
does not have daylight savings time.

Using \code{"month"} first advances the month without changing the
day: if this results in an invalid day of the month, it is counted
forward into the next month: see the examples.

\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{object}] \R{} object to serialize.
\item[\code{connection}] an open \LinkA{connection}{connection} or (for \code{serialize})
\code{NULL} or (for \code{unserialize}) a raw vector
(see `Details').
\item[\code{ascii}] a logical.  If \code{TRUE}, an ASCII representation is
written; otherwise binary one.  The default is \code{TRUE} for a
text-mode connection and \code{FALSE} otherwise.
See also the comments in the help for \code{\LinkA{save}{save}}.
\item[\code{xdr}] a logical: if a binary representation is used, should a
big-endian one (XDR) be used?
\item[\code{version}] the workspace format version to use.  \code{NULL}
specifies the current default version (2).  Versions prior to 2 are not
supported, so this will only be relevant when there are later versions.
\item[\code{refhook}] a hook function for handling reference objects.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The function \code{serialize} serializes \code{object} to the specified
connection.  If \code{connection} is \code{NULL} then \code{object} is
serialized to a raw vector, which is returned as the result of
\code{serialize}.

Sharing of reference objects is preserved within the object but not
across separate calls to \code{serialize}.

\code{unserialize} reads an object (as written by \code{serialize})
from \code{connection} or a raw vector.

The \code{refhook} functions can be used to customize handling of
non-system reference objects (all external pointers and weak
references, and all environments other than namespace and package
environments and \code{.GlobalEnv}).  The hook function for
\code{serialize} should return a character vector for references it
wants to handle; otherwise it should return \code{NULL}.  The hook for
\code{unserialize} will be called with character vectors supplied to
\code{serialize} and should return an appropriate object.

For a text-mode connection, the default value of \code{ascii} is set
to \code{TRUE}: only ASCII representations can be written to text-mode
connections and attempting to use \code{ascii = FALSE} will throw an
error.

The format consists of a single line followed by the data: the first
line contains a single character: \code{X} for binary serialization
and \code{A} for ASCII serialization, followed by a new line.  (The
format used is identical to that used by \code{\LinkA{readRDS}{readRDS}}.)

The option of \code{xdr = FALSE} was introduced in \R{} 2.15.0.  As
almost all systems in current use are little-endian, this can be used
to avoid byte-shuffling at both ends when transferring data from one
little-endian machine to another.  Depending on the system, this can
speed up serialization and unserialization by a factor of up to 3x.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
For \code{serialize}, \code{NULL} unless \code{connection = NULL}, when
the result is returned in a raw vector.

For \code{unserialize} an \R{} object.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{Warning}
These functions have provided a stable interface since \R{} 2.4.0 (when
the storage of serialized objects was changed from character to raw
vectors).  However, the serialization format may change in future
versions of \R{}, so this interface should not be used for long-term
storage of \R{} objects.

A raw vector is limited to \eqn{2^{31} - 1}{} bytes, but \R{}
objects can exceed this and their serializations will normally be
larger than the objects.

\code{setTimeLimit} sets limits which apply to each top-level
computation, that is a command line (including any continuation lines)
entered at the console or from a file.  If it is called from within a
computation the limits apply to the rest of the computation and
(unless \code{transient = TRUE}) to subsequent top-level computations.

\code{setSessionTimeLimit} sets limits for the rest of the
session.  Once a session limit is reached it is reset to \code{Inf}.

Setting any limit has a small overhead -- well under 1\% on the
systems measured.

Time limits are checked whenever a user interrupt could occur.
This will happen frequently in \R{} code and during \code{\LinkA{Sys.sleep}{Sys.sleep}},
but only at points in compiled C and Fortran code identified by the
code author.

\begin{verbatim}
shell(cmd, shell, flag = "/c", intern = FALSE, wait = TRUE,
      translate = FALSE, mustWork = FALSE, ...)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{cmd}] the system command to be invoked, as a string.
\item[\code{shell}] a string giving the name of the shell to be used, or
\code{NULL} (no shell).  If missing, a suitable shell is chosen:
see `Details'.
\item[\code{flag}] the switch to run a command under the shell.  If the shell
is \code{bash} or \code{tcsh} or \code{sh} the default is changed to
\code{"-c"}.
\item[\code{intern}] a logical, indicates whether to make the output of the
command an \R{} object.
\item[\code{wait}] should the \R{} interpreter wait for the command to finish?
The default is to wait, and the interpreter will always wait if
\code{intern = TRUE}.
\item[\code{translate}] If \code{TRUE}, \samp{"/"} in \code{cmd} is
translated to \samp{"\bsl{}"}.
\item[\code{mustWork}] a logical; if \code{TRUE} failure to run the command
will give an \R{} error, if \code{FALSE} a warning and if \code{NA},
no \R{} message.
\item[\code{...}] additional arguments to \code{\LinkA{system}{system}}.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
If no \code{shell} is specified, the environment variables
\env{R\_SHELL}, \env{SHELL} and \env{COMSPEC} are tried in turn:
\env{COMSPEC} should always succeed.  Using \code{shell = NULL}
invokes the command \code{cmd} directly, in which case an extension
of \file{.exe} is assumed.  It is possible to use batch files
directly if their extension is given: Windows (rather than \R{}) then
chooses a shell.

See \code{\LinkA{system}{system}} for fuller details: \code{shell} is a more
user-friendly wrapper for \code{system}.  To make use of Windows
file associations, use \code{\LinkA{shell.exec}{shell.exec}}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
If \code{intern = TRUE}, a character vector giving the output of the
command, one line per character string, or an error message if the
command could not be run.

If \code{intern = FALSE}, the return value is an error code, given the
invisible attribute (so needs to be printed explicitly).  If the
command could not be run for any reason, the value is \code{-1} and
an \R{} warning is generated.  Otherwise if \code{wait = FALSE} the value
is the error code returned by the command, and if \code{wait = TRUE}
it is the zero (the conventional success value),

If \code{intern = FALSE} and \code{wait = TRUE} (the defaults) the text
output from a command that is a console application will appear in
the \R{} console (\code{Rgui}) or the window running \R{} (\code{Rterm}).

\item[\code{all}] logical: if true all connections, including closed ones
and the standard ones are displayed.  If false only open user-created
connections are included.

\item[\code{what}] integer: a row number of the table given by
\code{showConnections}.

\item[\code{con}] a connection.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{stdin()}, \code{stdout()} and \code{stderr()} are standard
connections corresponding to input, output and error on the console
respectively (and not necessarily to file streams).  They are text-mode
connections of class \code{"terminal"} which cannot be opened or
closed, and are read-only, write-only and write-only respectively.
The \code{stdout()} and \code{stderr()} connections can be
re-directed by \code{\LinkA{sink}{sink}} (and in some circumstances the
output from \code{stdout()} can be split: see the help page).

The encoding for \code{\LinkA{stdin}{stdin}()} when redirected can
be set by the command-line flag \option{--encoding}.

\code{showConnections} returns a matrix of information.  If a
connection object has been lost or forgotten, \code{getConnection}
will take a row number from the table and return a connection object
for that connection, which can be used to close the connection,
for example.  However, if there is no \R{} level object referring to the
connection it will be closed automatically at the next garbage
collection (except for \code{\LinkA{gzcon}{gzcon}} connections).

\code{closeAllConnections} closes (and destroys) all user
connections, restoring all \code{\LinkA{sink}{sink}} diversions as it does
so.

\code{isatty} returns true if the connection is one of the class
\code{"terminal"} connections and it is apparently connected to a
terminal, otherwise false.  This may not be reliable in embedded
applications, including GUI consoles.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{stdin()}, \code{stdout()} and \code{stderr()} return connection
objects.

\code{showConnections} returns a character matrix of information with
a row for each connection, by default only for open non-standard connections.

\code{getConnection} returns a connection object, or \code{NULL}.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
\code{stdin()} refers to the `console' and not to the C-level
\file{stdin} of the process.  The distinction matters in GUI consoles
(which may not have an active \file{stdin}, and if they do it may not
be connected to console input), and also in embedded applications.
If you want access to the C-level file stream \file{stdin}, use
\code{\LinkA{file}{file}("stdin")}.

When \R{} is reading a script from a file, the \emph{file} is the
`console': this is traditional usage to allow in-line data (see
`An Introduction to R' for an example).

\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
shQuote(string, type = c("sh", "csh", "cmd"))
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{string}] a character vector, usually of length one.
\item[\code{type}] character: the type of shell.  Partial matching is
supported.  \code{"cmd"} refers to the Windows NT shell, and is the
default under Windows.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The default type of quoting supported under Unix-alikes is that for
the Bourne shell \code{sh}.  If the string does not contain single
quotes, we can just surround it with single quotes.  Otherwise, the
string is surrounded in double quotes, which suppresses all special
meanings of metacharacters except dollar, backquote and backslash, so
these (and of course double quote) are preceded by backslash.  This
type of quoting is also appropriate for \code{bash}, \code{ksh} and
\code{zsh}.

The other type of quoting is for the C-shell (\code{csh} and
\code{tcsh}).  Once again, if the string does not contain single
quotes, we can just surround it with single quotes.  If it does
contain single quotes, we can use double quotes provided it does not
contain dollar or backquote (and we need to escape backslash,
exclamation mark and double quote).  As a last resort, we need to
split the string into pieces not containing single quotes and surround
each with single quotes, and the single quotes with double quotes.

The Windows shell supports only double quoting.  All this
implementation does is to surround the string by double quotes and
escape internal double quotes by a backslash.  As Windows path names
cannot contain double quotes, this makes \code{shQuote} safe for use
with file paths in \code{\LinkA{system}{system}}, and with \code{\LinkA{shell}{shell}}
if the default shell is used.

It will usually be safe to use \code{shQuote} to quote arguments of a
command, but because \code{\LinkA{system}{system}} does not use a shell,
interpretation of quoted arguments is done by the run-time code of the
executable.  This may depend on the compiler used: Microsoft's rules
for the C run-time are given at
\url{http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms880421.aspx}.

\item[\code{type}] character.  Either the output stream or the messages
stream.
\item[\code{split}] logical: if \code{TRUE}, output will be sent to the new
sink and to the current output stream, like the Unix program \code{tee}.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{sink} diverts \R{} output to a connection.  If \code{file} is a
character string, a file connection with that name will be established
for the duration of the diversion.

Normal \R{} output (to connection \code{\LinkA{stdout}{stdout}}) is diverted by
the default \code{type = "output"}.  Only prompts and (most)
messages continue to appear on the console.  Messages sent to
\code{\LinkA{stderr}{stderr}()} (including those from \code{\LinkA{message}{message}},
\code{\LinkA{warning}{warning}} and \code{\LinkA{stop}{stop}}) can be diverted by
\code{sink(type = "message")} (see below).

\code{sink()} or \code{sink(file=NULL)} ends the last diversion (of
the specified type).  There is a stack of diversions for normal
output, so output reverts to the previous diversion (if there was
one).  The stack is of up to 21 connections (20 diversions).

If \code{file} is a connection it will be opened if necessary (in
\code{"wt"} mode) and closed once it is removed from the stack of
diversions.

\code{split = TRUE} only splits \R{} output (via \code{Rvprintf}) and
the default output from \code{\LinkA{writeLines}{writeLines}}: it does not split
all output that might be sent to \code{\LinkA{stdout}{stdout}()}.

Sink-ing the messages stream should be done only with great care.
For that stream \code{file} must be an already open connection, and
there is no stack of connections.

If \code{file} is a character string, the file will be opened using
the current encoding.  If you want a different encoding (e.g. to
represent strings which have been stored in UTF-8), use a
\code{\LinkA{file}{file}} connection --- but some ways to produce \R{} output
will already have converted such strings to the current encoding.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{sink} returns \code{NULL}.

For \code{sink.number()} the number (0, 1, 2, \dots) of diversions of
output in place.

For \code{sink.number("message")} the connection number used for
messages, 2 if no diversion has been used.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{Warning}
Do not use a connection that is open for \code{sink} for any other
purpose.  The software will stop you closing one such inadvertently.

Do not sink the messages stream unless you understand the source code
implementing it and hence the pitfalls.

Sort (or \emph{order}) a vector or factor (partially) into
ascending or descending order.  For ordering along more than one
variable, e.g., for sorting data frames, see \code{\LinkA{order}{order}}.
\end{Description}

\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
sort(x, decreasing = FALSE, ...)

## Default S3 method:
sort(x, decreasing = FALSE, na.last = NA, ...)

sort.int(x, partial = NULL, na.last = NA, decreasing = FALSE,
         method = c("shell", "quick"), index.return = FALSE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] for \code{sort} an \R{} object with a class or a numeric,
complex, character or logical vector.  For \code{sort.int}, a
numeric, complex, character or logical vector, or a factor.
\item[\code{decreasing}] logical.  Should the sort be increasing or decreasing?
Not available for partial sorting.
\item[\code{...}] arguments to be passed to or from methods or (for the
default methods and objects without a class) to \code{sort.int}.
\item[\code{na.last}] for controlling the treatment of \code{NA}s.
If \code{TRUE}, missing values in the data are put last; if
\code{FALSE}, they are put first; if \code{NA}, they are removed.
\item[\code{partial}] \code{NULL} or a  vector of indices for partial sorting.
\item[\code{method}] character string specifying the algorithm used.  Not
available for partial sorting.
\item[\code{index.return}] logical indicating if the ordering index vector should
be returned as well; this is only available for a few cases, the default
\code{na.last = NA} and full sorting of non-factors.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{sort} is a generic function for which methods can be written,
and \code{sort.int} is the internal method which is compatible
with S if only the first three arguments are used.

The default \code{sort} method makes use of \code{\LinkA{order}{order}} for
classed objects, which in turn makes use of the generic function
\code{\LinkA{xtfrm}{xtfrm}} (and can be slow unless a \code{xtfrm} method has
been defined or \code{\LinkA{is.numeric}{is.numeric}(x)} is true).

Complex values are sorted first by the real part, then the imaginary
part.

The sort order for character vectors will depend on the collating
sequence of the locale in use: see \code{\LinkA{Comparison}{Comparison}}.
The sort order for factors is the order of their levels (which is
particularly appropriate for ordered factors).


If \code{partial} is not \code{NULL}, it is taken to contain indices
of elements of the result which are to be placed in their correct
positions in the sorted array by partial sorting.  For each of the
result values in a specified position, any values smaller than that
one are guaranteed to have a smaller index in the sorted array and any
values which are greater are guaranteed to have a bigger index in the
sorted array.  (This is included for efficiency, and many of the
options are not available for partial sorting.  It is only
substantially more efficient if \code{partial} has a handful of
elements, and a full sort is done (a Quicksort if possible) if there
are more than 10.)  Names are discarded for partial sorting.

Method \code{"shell"} uses Shellsort (an \eqn{O(n^{4/3})}{} variant
from Sedgewick (1996)).  If \code{x} has names a stable sort is used,
so ties are not reordered.  (This only matters if names are present.)

Method \code{"quick"} uses Singleton (1969)'s implementation of
Hoare's Quicksort method and is only available when \code{x} is
numeric (double or integer) and \code{partial} is \code{NULL}.  (For
other types of \code{x} Shellsort is used, silently.)  It is normally
somewhat faster than Shellsort (perhaps 50\% faster on vectors of
length a million and twice as fast at a billion) but has poor
performance in the rare worst case.  (Peto's modification using a
pseudo-random midpoint is used to make the worst case rarer.)  This is
not a stable sort, and ties may be reordered.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
For \code{sort}, the result depends on the S3 method which is
dispatched.  If \code{x} does not have a class \code{sort.int} is used
and it description applies.  For classed objects which do not have a
specific method the default method will be used and is equivalent to
\code{x[order(x, ...)]}: this depends on the class having a suitable
method for \code{[} (and also that \code{\LinkA{order}{order}} will work,
which is not the case for a class based on a list).

For \code{sort.int} the value is the sorted vector unless
\code{index.return} is true, when the result is a list with components
named \code{x} and \code{ix} containing the sorted numbers and the
ordering index vector.  In the latter case, if \code{method ==
    "quick"} ties may be reversed in the ordering (unlike
\code{sort.list}) as quicksort is not stable.  NB: the index vector
refers to element numbers \emph{after removal of \code{NA}s}: see
\code{\LinkA{order}{order}} if you want the original element numbers.

All attributes are removed from the return value (see Becker \emph{et
al}, 1988, p.146) except names, which are sorted.  (If
\code{partial} is specified even the names are removed.)  Note that
this means that the returned value has no class, except for factors
and ordered factors (which are treated specially and whose result is
transformed back to the original class).

%
\begin{Description}\relax
\code{source} causes \R{} to accept its input from the named file or URL
or connection.  Input is read and \code{\LinkA{parse}{parse}}d from that file
until the end of the file is reached, then the parsed expressions are
evaluated sequentially in the chosen environment.
\end{Description}

\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{file}] a \LinkA{connection}{connection} or a character string giving the pathname
of the file or URL to read from.  \code{""} indicates the connection
\code{\LinkA{stdin}{stdin}()}.
\item[\code{local}] \code{TRUE}, \code{FALSE} or an environment, determining
where the parsed expressions are evaluated.  \code{FALSE} (the
default) corresponds to the user's workspace (the global
environment) and \code{TRUE} to the environment from which
\code{source} is called.
\item[\code{echo}] logical; if \code{TRUE}, each expression is printed
after parsing, before evaluation.
\item[\code{print.eval}] logical; if \code{TRUE}, the result of
\code{eval(i)} is printed for each expression \code{i}; defaults
to the value of \code{echo}.
\item[\code{verbose}] if \code{TRUE}, more diagnostics (than just
\code{echo = TRUE}) are printed during parsing and evaluation of
input, including extra info for \bold{each} expression.
\item[\code{prompt.echo}] character; gives the prompt to be used if
\code{echo = TRUE}.
\item[\code{max.deparse.length}] integer; is used only if \code{echo} is
\code{TRUE} and gives the maximal number of characters output for
the deparse of a single expression.
\item[\code{chdir}] logical; if \code{TRUE} and \code{file} is a pathname,
the \R{} working directory is temporarily changed to the directory
containing \code{file} for evaluating.
\item[\code{encoding}] character vector.  The encoding(s) to be assumed when
\code{file} is a character string: see \code{\LinkA{file}{file}}.  A
possible value is \code{"unknown"} when the encoding is guessed: see
the `Encodings' section.
\item[\code{continue.echo}] character; gives the prompt to use on
continuation lines if \code{echo = TRUE}.
\item[\code{skip.echo}] integer; how many comment lines at the start of the
file to skip if \code{echo = TRUE}.
\item[\code{keep.source}] logical: should the source formatting be retained
when echoing expressions, if possible?
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
Note that running code via \code{source} differs in a few respects
from entering it at the \R{} command line.  Since expressions are not
executed at the top level, auto-printing is not done.  So you will
need to include explicit \code{print} calls for things you want to be
printed (and remember that this includes plotting by \Rhref{http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lattice}{\pkg{lattice}},
FAQ Q7.22).  Since the complete file is parsed before any of it is
run, syntax errors result in none of the code being run.  If an error
occurs in running a syntactically correct script, anything assigned
into the workspace by code that has been run will be kept (just as
from the command line), but diagnostic information such as
\code{\LinkA{traceback}{traceback}()} will contain additional calls to
\code{\LinkA{withVisible}{withVisible}}.

All versions of \R{} accept input from a connection with end of line
marked by LF (as used on Unix), CRLF (as used on DOS/Windows) or CR
(as used on classic Mac OS) and map this to newline.  The final line
can be incomplete, that is missing the final end-of-line marker.

If \code{keep.source} is true (the default in interactive use), the
source of functions is kept so they can be listed exactly as input.








Unlike input from a console, lines in the file or on a connection can
contain an unlimited number of characters.

When \code{skip.echo > 0}, that many comment lines at the start of
the file will not be echoed.  This does not affect the execution of
the code at all.  If there are executable lines within the first
\code{skip.echo} lines, echoing will start with the first of them.

If \code{echo} is true and a deparsed expression exceeds
\code{max.deparse.length}, that many characters are output followed by
\code{ .... [TRUNCATED] }.  
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Section}{Encodings}
By default the input is read and parsed in  the current encoding of
the \R{} session.  This is usually what it required, but occasionally
re-encoding is needed, e.g. if a file from a UTF-8-using system is to
be read on Windows (or \emph{vice versa}).

The rest of this paragraph applies if \code{file} is an actual
filename or URL (and not \code{""} nor a connection).  If
\code{encoding = "unknown"}, an attempt is made to guess the encoding:
the result of \code{\LinkA{localeToCharset}{localeToCharset}()} is used as a guide.  If
\code{encoding} has two or more elements, they are tried in turn until
the file/URL can be read without error in the trial encoding.  If an
actual \code{encoding} is specified (rather than the default or
\code{"unknown"}) in a Latin-1 or UTF-8 locale then character strings
in the result will be translated to the current encoding and marked as
such (see \code{\LinkA{Encoding}{Encoding}}).

If \code{file} is a connection (including one specified by \code{""},
it is not possible to re-encode the input inside \code{source}, and so
the \code{encoding} argument is just used to mark character strings in the
parsed input in Latin-1 and UTF-8 locales: see \code{\LinkA{parse}{parse}}.

\begin{Details}\relax
The functions \code{beta} and \code{lbeta} return the beta function
and the natural logarithm of the beta function,
\deqn{B(a,b) = \frac{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)}{\Gamma(a+b)}.}{}
The formal definition is
\deqn{B(a, b) = \int_0^1 t^{a-1} (1-t)^{b-1} dt}{}
(Abramowitz and Stegun section 6.2.1, page 258).  Note that it is only
defined in \R{} for non-negative \code{a} and \code{b}, and is infinite
if either is zero.

The functions \code{gamma} and \code{lgamma} return the gamma function
\eqn{\Gamma(x)}{} and the natural logarithm of \emph{the absolute value of} the
gamma function.  The gamma function is defined by
(Abramowitz and Stegun section 6.1.1, page 255)
\deqn{\Gamma(x) = \int_0^\infty t^{x-1} e^{-t} dt}{}
for all real \code{x} except zero and negative integers (when
\code{NaN} is returned).  There will be a warning on possible loss of
precision for values which are too close (within about
\eqn{10^{-8}}{})) to a negative integer less than \samp{-10}.

\code{factorial(x)} (\eqn{x!}{} for non-negative integer \code{x})
is defined to be \code{gamma(x+1)} and \code{lfactorial} to be
\code{lgamma(x+1)}.

The functions \code{digamma} and \code{trigamma} return the first and second
derivatives of the logarithm of the gamma function.
\code{psigamma(x, deriv)} (\code{deriv >= 0}) computes the
\code{deriv}-th derivative of \eqn{\psi(x)}{}.
\deqn{\code{digamma(x)} = \psi(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\ln\Gamma(x) =
    \frac{\Gamma'(x)}{\Gamma(x)}}{}
This is often called the `polygamma' function, e.g. in
Abramowitz and Stegun (section 6.4.1, page 260); and higher
derivatives (\code{deriv = 2:4}) have occasionally been called
`tetragamma', `pentagamma', and `hexagamma'.

The functions \code{choose} and \code{lchoose} return binomial
coefficients and the logarithms of their absolute values.  Note that
\code{choose(n,k)} is defined for all real numbers \eqn{n}{} and integer
\eqn{k}{}.  For \eqn{k \ge 1}{} it is defined as
\eqn{n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1) / k!}{},
as \eqn{1}{} for \eqn{k = 0}{} and as \eqn{0}{} for negative \eqn{k}{}.
Non-integer values of \code{k} are rounded to an integer, with a warning.
\\{} \code{choose(*,k)} uses direct arithmetic (instead of
\code{[l]gamma} calls) for small \code{k}, for speed and accuracy
reasons.  Note the function \code{\LinkA{combn}{combn}} (package
\pkg{utils}) for enumeration of all possible combinations.

The \code{gamma}, \code{lgamma}, \code{digamma} and \code{trigamma}
functions are \LinkA{internal generic}{internal generic} \LinkA{primitive}{primitive} functions: methods can be
defined for them individually or via the
\code{\LinkA{Math}{S3groupGeneric}} group generic.

\code{split} divides the data in the vector \code{x} into the groups
defined by \code{f}.  The replacement forms replace values
corresponding to such a division.  \code{unsplit} reverses the effect of
\code{split}.

\begin{verbatim}
split(x, f, drop = FALSE, ...)
split(x, f, drop = FALSE, ...) <- value
unsplit(value, f, drop = FALSE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] vector or data frame containing values to be divided into groups.
\item[\code{f}] a `factor' in the sense that \code{\LinkA{as.factor}{as.factor}(f)}
defines the grouping, or a list of such factors in which case their
interaction is used for the grouping.
\item[\code{drop}] logical indicating if levels that do not occur should be dropped
(if \code{f} is a \code{factor} or a list).
\item[\code{value}] a list of vectors or data frames compatible with a
splitting of \code{x}. Recycling applies if the lengths do not match.
\item[\code{...}] further potential arguments passed to methods.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{split} and \code{split<-} are generic functions with default and
\code{data.frame} methods.
The data frame
method can also be used to split a matrix into a list of matrices,
and the replacement form likewise, provided they are invoked
explicitly.

\code{unsplit} works with lists of vectors or data frames (assumed to
have compatible structure, as if created by \code{split}). It puts
elements or rows back in the positions given by \code{f}. In the data
frame case, row names are obtained by unsplitting the row name
vectors from the elements of \code{value}.

\code{f} is recycled as necessary and if the length of \code{x} is not
a multiple of the length of \code{f} a warning is printed.

Any missing values in \code{f} are dropped together with the
corresponding values of \code{x}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
The value returned from \code{split} is a list of vectors containing
the values for the groups.  The components of the list are named by
the levels of \code{f} (after converting to a factor, or if already a
factor and \code{drop=TRUE}, dropping unused levels).

The replacement forms return their right hand side.  \code{unsplit}
returns a vector or data frame for which \code{split(x, f)} equals
\code{value}

\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
sprintf(fmt, ...)

\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{fmt}] a character vector of format strings, each of up to 8192 bytes.
\item[\code{...}] values to be passed into \code{fmt}.  Only logical,
integer, real and character vectors are supported, but some coercion
will be done: see the `Details' section.
\item[\code{domain}] see \code{\LinkA{gettext}{gettext}}.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{sprintf} is a wrapper for the system \code{sprintf} C-library
function.  Attempts are made to check that the mode of the values
passed match the format supplied, and \R{}'s special values (\code{NA},
\code{Inf}, \code{-Inf} and \code{NaN}) are handled correctly.

\code{gettextf} is a convenience function which provides C-style
string formatting with possible translation of the format string.

The arguments (including \code{fmt}) are recycled if possible a whole
number of times to the length of the longest, and then the formatting
is done in parallel.  Zero-length arguments are allowed and will give
a zero-length result.  All arguments are evaluated even if unused, and
hence some types (e.g., \code{"symbol"} or \code{"language"}, see
\code{\LinkA{typeof}{typeof}}) are not allowed.

The following is abstracted from Kernighan and Ritchie (see
References): however the actual implementation will follow the C99
standard and fine details (especially the behaviour under user error)
may depend on the platform.

The string \code{fmt} contains normal characters,
which are passed through to the output string, and also conversion
specifications which operate on the arguments provided through
\code{...}.  The allowed conversion specifications start with a
\code{\%} and end with one of the letters in the set
\code{aAdifeEgGosxX\%}.  These letters denote the following types:

\begin{description}

\item[\code{d, i, o, x, X}] Integer value, \code{o} being octal,
\code{x} and \code{X} being hexadecimal (using the same case for
\code{a-f} as the code).  Numeric variables with exactly integer
values will be coerced to integer.  Formats \code{d} and \code{i}
can also be used for logical variables, which will be converted to
\code{0}, \code{1} or \code{NA}.

\item[\code{f}] Double precision value, in ``\bold{f}ixed
point'' decimal notation of the form "[-]mmm.ddd".  The number of
decimal places ("d") is specified by the precision: the default is 6;
a precision of 0 suppresses the decimal point.  Non-finite values
are converted to \code{NA}, \code{NaN} or (perhaps a sign followed
by) \code{Inf}.

\item[\code{e, E}] Double precision value, in
``\bold{e}xponential'' decimal notation of the
form \code{[-]m.ddde[+-]xx} or \code{[-]m.dddE[+-]xx}.

\item[\code{g, G}] Double precision value, in \code{\%e} or
\code{\%E} format if the exponent is less than -4 or greater than or
equal to the precision, and \code{\%f} format otherwise.
(The precision (default 6) specifies the number of
\emph{significant} digits here, whereas in \code{\%f, \%e}, it is
the number of digits after the decimal point.)

\item[\code{a, A}] Double precision value, in binary notation of the
form \code{[-]0xh.hhhp[+-]d}.  This is a binary fraction
expressed in hex multiplied by a (decimal) power of 2.  The number
of hex digits after the decimal point is specified by the precision:
the default is enough digits to represent exactly the internal
binary representation.  Non-finite values are converted to \code{NA},
\code{NaN} or (perhaps a sign followed by) \code{Inf}.  Format
\code{\%a} uses lower-case for \code{x}, \code{p} and the hex
values: format \code{\%A} uses upper-case.

This should be supported on all platforms as it is a feature of C99.
The format is not uniquely defined: although it would be possible
to make the leading \code{h} always zero or one, this is not
always done.  Most systems will suppress trailing zeros, but a few
do not.  On a well-written platform, for normal numbers there will
be a leading one before the decimal point plus (by default) 13
hexadecimal digits, hence 53 bits.  The treatment of denormalized
(aka `subnormal') numbers is very platform-dependent.

\item[\code{s}] Character string.  Character \code{NA}s are
converted to \code{"NA"}.

\item[\code{\%}] Literal \code{\%} (none of the extra formatting
characters given below are permitted in this case).


\end{description}

Conversion by \code{\LinkA{as.character}{as.character}} is used for non-character
arguments with \code{s} and by \code{\LinkA{as.double}{as.double}} for
non-double arguments with \code{f, e, E, g, G}.  NB: the length is
determined before conversion, so do not rely on the internal
coercion if this would change the length.  The coercion is done only
once, so if \code{length(fmt) > 1} then all elements must expect the
same types of arguments.

In addition, between the initial \code{\%} and the terminating
conversion character there may be, in any order:

\begin{description}

\item[\code{m.n}] Two numbers separated by a period, denoting the
field width (\code{m}) and the precision (\code{n}).
\item[\code{-}] Left adjustment of converted argument in its field.
\item[\code{+}] Always print number with sign: by default only
negative numbers are printed with a sign.
\item[a space] Prefix a space if the first character is not a sign.
\item[\code{0}] For numbers, pad to the field width with leading zeros.
\item[\code{\#}] specifies ``alternate output'' for numbers, its
action depending on the type:
For \code{x} or \code{X}, \code{0x} or \code{0X} will be prefixed
to a non-zero result.  For \code{e}, \code{e}, \code{f}, \code{g}
and \code{G}, the output will always have a decimal point; for
\code{g} and \code{G}, trailing zeros will not be removed.


\end{description}

Further, immediately after \code{\%} may come \code{1\$} to \code{99\$}
to refer to numbered argument: this allows arguments to be
referenced out of order and is mainly intended for translators of
error messages.  If this is done it is best if all formats are
numbered: if not the unnumbered ones process the arguments in order.
See the examples.  This notation allows arguments to be used more than
once, in which case they must be used as the same type (integer,
double or character).

A field width or precision (but not both) may be indicated by an
asterisk \code{*}: in this case an argument specifies the desired
number.  A negative field width is taken as a '-' flag followed by a
positive field width.  A negative precision is treated as if the
precision were omitted.  The argument should be integer, but a double
argument will be coerced to integer.

There is a limit of 8192 bytes on elements of \code{fmt}, and on
strings included from a single \code{\%}\emph{letter} conversion
specification.

Field widths and precisions of \code{\%s} conversions are interpreted
as bytes, not characters, as described in the C standard.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
A character vector of length that of the longest input.  If any
element of \code{fmt} or any character argument is declared as UTF-8,
the element of the result will be in UTF-8 and have the encoding
declared as UTF-8.  Otherwise it will be in the current locale's
encoding.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{Warning}
The format string is passed down the OS's \code{sprintf} function, and
incorrect formats can cause the latter to crash the \R{} process .  \R{}
does perform sanity checks on the format, and since \R{} 2.10.0, we have
not seen crashes anymore.  But not all possible user errors on all
platforms have been tested, and some might be terminal.

The behaviour on inputs not documented here is `undefined',
which means it is allowed to differ by platform.

\begin{Details}\relax
The purpose of the functions is to provide a simple means of markup
for quoting text to be used in the R output, e.g., in warnings or
error messages.

The choice of the appropriate quotation marks depends on both the
locale and the available character sets.  Older Unix/X11 fonts
displayed the grave accent (ASCII code 0x60) and the apostrophe (0x27)
in a way that they could also be used as matching open and close
single quotation marks.  Using modern fonts, or non-Unix systems,
these characters no longer produce matching glyphs.  Unicode provides
left and right single quotation mark characters (U+2018 and U+2019);
if Unicode markup cannot be assumed to be available, it seems good
practice to use the apostrophe as a non-directional single quotation
mark.

Similarly, Unicode has left and right double quotation mark characters
(U+201C and U+201D); if only ASCII's typewriter characteristics can be
employed, than the ASCII quotation mark (0x22) should be used as both
the left and right double quotation mark.

Some other locales also have the directional quotation marks, notably
on Windows.  TeX uses grave and apostrophe for the directional single
quotation marks, and doubled grave and doubled apostrophe for the
directional double quotation marks.

What rendering is used depend on the \code{\LinkA{options}{options}} setting for
\code{useFancyQuotes}.  If this is \code{FALSE} then the undirectional
ASCII quotation style is used.  If this is \code{TRUE} (the default),
Unicode directional quotes are used are used where available
(currently, UTF-8 locales on Unix-alikes and all Windows locales
except \code{C}): if set to \code{"UTF-8"} UTF-8 markup is used
(whatever the current locale). If set to \code{"TeX"}, TeX-style
markup is used.  Finally, if this is set to a character vector of
length four, the first two entries are used for beginning and ending
single quotes and the second two for beginning and ending double
quotes: this can be used to implement non-English quoting conventions
such as the use of guillemets.

Where fancy quotes are used, you should be aware that they may not be
rendered correctly as not all fonts include the requisite glyphs: for
example some have directional single quotes but not directional double
quotes.
This is particularly troublesome in Windows `Command Prompt'
windows, which by default are set up to run in the so-called OEM
codepage, which in most locales uses a different encoding from
Windows.  Further, if the codepage is changed (with \code{chcp.exe},
e.g. to 1252 in a Western European language), the default raster fonts
do not support the directional quotes.

To work around this, the default for \code{options("useFancyQuotes")}
is \code{FALSE} on Windows except for the \code{Rgui} console.  There
fancy quotes work with the default Courier New font and more elegantly with
Lucida Console and standard the CJK fonts, but directional double
quotes are missing in raster fonts such as Courier and FixedSys.

These functions and classes handle source code references.

The \code{srcfile} function produces an object of class
\code{srcfile}, which contains the name and directory of a source code
file, along with its timestamp, for use in source level debugging (not
yet implemented) and source echoing.  The encoding of the file is
saved; see \code{\LinkA{file}{file}} for a discussion of encodings, and
\code{\LinkA{iconvlist}{iconvlist}} for a list of allowable encodings on your platform.

The \code{srcfilecopy} function produces an object of the descendant
class \code{srcfilecopy}, which saves the source lines in a character
vector.  It copies the value of the \code{isFile} argument, to help
debuggers identify whether this text comes from a real file in the
file system.

The \code{srcfilealias} function produces an object of the descendant
class \code{srcfilealias}, which gives an alternate name to another 
srcfile.  This is produced by the parser when a \code{\#line} directive
is used.

The \code{getSrcLines} function reads the specified lines from
\code{srcfile}.

The \code{srcref} function produces an object of class
\code{srcref}, which describes a range of characters in a \code{
  srcfile}.  The \code{lloc} value gives the following values: \code{c
  (first\_line, first\_byte, last\_line, last\_byte, first\_column,
  last\_column, first\_parsed, last\_parsed)}. Bytes (elements 2, 4) and
columns (elements 5, 6) may be different due to multibyte
characters.  If only four values are given, the columns and bytes
are assumed to match.  Lines (elements 1, 3) and parsed lines (
elements 7, 8) may differ if a \code{\#line} directive is used in
code:  the former will respect the directive, the latter will just
count lines.  If only 4 or 6 elements are given, the parsed lines
will be assumed to match the lines.

Methods are defined for \code{print}, \code{summary}, \code{open},
and \code{close} for classes \code{srcfile} and \code{srcfilecopy}.
The \code{open} method opens its internal \code{\LinkA{file}{file}} connection at
a particular line; if it was already open, it will be repositioned
to that line.

Methods are defined for \code{print}, \code{summary} and 
\code{as.character} for class \code{srcref}.  The \code{as.character}
method will read the associated source file to obtain the text
corresponding to the reference.  The exact behaviour depends on the
class of the source file.  If the source file inherits from
class \code{"srcfilecopy"}, the lines are taken from the saved copy 
using the "parsed" line counts.  If not, an attempt
is made to read the file, and the original line numbers of the 
\code{srcref} record (i.e. elements 1 and 3) are used.  If an error
occurs (e.g. the file no longer exists), text like 
\code{<srcref: "file" chars 1:1 to 2:10>} will be returned instead,
indicating the \code{line:column} ranges of the first and last
character.  The \code{summary} method defaults to this type of
display.  

Lists of \code{srcref} objects may be attached to expressions as the
\code{"srcref"} attribute.  (The list of \code{srcref} objects should be the same
length as the expression.)  By default, expressions are printed by
\code{\LinkA{print.default}{print.default}} using the associated \code{srcref}.  To
see deparsed code instead, call \code{\LinkA{print}{print}} with argument
\code{useSource = FALSE}.  If a \code{srcref} object
is printed with \code{useSource = FALSE}, the \code{<srcref: ...>}
record will be printed.

\code{.isOpen} is intended for internal use:  it checks whether the
connection associated with a \code{srcfile} object is open.

\begin{Description}\relax
In \R{}, the startup mechanism is as follows.

Unless \option{--no-environ} was given on the command line, \R{}
searches for site and user files to process for setting environment
variables.  The name of the site file is the one pointed to by the
environment variable \env{R\_ENVIRON}; if this is unset,
\file{\var{\LinkA{R\_HOME}{R.Rul.HOME}}/etc/Renviron.site} is used (if it exists,
which it does not in a `factory-fresh' installation).  The name
of the user file can be specified by the \env{R\_ENVIRON\_USER}
environment variable; if this is unset, the files searched for are
\file{.Renviron} in the current or in the user's home directory (in
that order).  See `Details' for how the files are read.

Then \R{} searches for the site-wide startup profile file of \R{} code
unless the command line option \option{--no-site-file} was given.  The
path of this file is taken from the value of the \env{R\_PROFILE}
environment variable (after \LinkA{tilde expansion}{tilde expansion}).  If this variable
is unset, the default is \file{\var{\LinkA{R\_HOME}{R.Rul.HOME}}/etc/Rprofile.site},
which is used if it exists
(it contains settings from the installer in a `factory-fresh'
installation).
This code is sourced into the \pkg{base} package.  Users need to be
careful not to unintentionally overwrite objects in \pkg{base}, and it
is normally advisable to use \code{\LinkA{local}{local}} if code needs to be
executed: see the examples.

Then, unless \option{--no-init-file} was given, \R{} searches for a user
profile, a file of \R{} code.  The path of this file can be specified by
the \env{R\_PROFILE\_USER} environment variable (and
\LinkA{tilde expansion}{tilde expansion} will be performed).  If this is unset, a file
called \file{.Rprofile} is searched for in the current directory or in
the user's home directory (in that order).  The user profile file is
sourced into the workspace.

Note that when the site and user profile files are sourced only the
\pkg{base} package is loaded, so objects in other packages need to be
referred to by e.g. \code{utils::dump.frames} or after explicitly
loading the package concerned.

\R{} then loads a saved image of the user workspace from \file{.RData}
in the current directory if there is one (unless
\option{--no-restore-data} or \option{--no-restore} was specified on
the command line).

Next, if a function \code{.First} is found on the search path,
it is executed as \code{.First()}.  Finally, function
\code{.First.sys()} in the \pkg{base} package is run.  This calls
\code{\LinkA{require}{require}} to attach the default packages specified by
\code{\LinkA{options}{options}("defaultPackages")}.  If the \pkg{methods}
package is included, this will have been attached earlier (by function
\code{.OptRequireMethods()}) so that namespace initializations such
as those from the user workspace will proceed correctly.

A function \code{.First} (and \code{\LinkA{.Last}{.Last}}) can be defined in
appropriate \file{.Rprofile} or \file{Rprofile.site} files or have
been saved in \file{.RData}.  If you want a different set of packages
than the default ones when you start, insert a call to
\code{\LinkA{options}{options}} in the \file{.Rprofile} or \file{Rprofile.site}
file.  For example, \code{options(defaultPackages = character())} will
attach no extra packages on startup (only the \pkg{base} package) (or
set \code{R\_DEFAULT\_PACKAGES=NULL} as an environment variable before
running \R{}).  Using \code{options(defaultPackages = "")} or
\code{R\_DEFAULT\_PACKAGES=""} enforces the R \emph{system} default.

On front-ends which support it, the commands history is read from the
file specified by the environment variable \env{R\_HISTFILE} (default
\file{.Rhistory} in the current directory) unless
\option{--no-restore-history} or \option{--no-restore} was specified.

The command-line option \option{--vanilla} implies
\option{--no-site-file}, \option{--no-init-file},
\option{--no-environ} and (except for \command{R CMD})
\option{--no-restore}
Under Windows, it also implies \option{--no-Rconsole}, which
prevents loading the \file{\LinkA{Rconsole}{Rconsole}} file.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
Note that there are two sorts of files used in startup:
\emph{environment files} which contain lists of environment variables
to be set, and \emph{profile files} which contain \R{} code.

Lines in a site or user environment file should be either comment
lines starting with \code{\#}, or lines of the form
\code{\var{name}=\var{value}}. The latter sets the environmental
variable \code{\var{name}} to \code{\var{value}}, overriding an
existing value.  If \code{\var{value}} contains an expression of the
form \code{\$\{foo-bar\}}, the value is that of the environmental
variable \code{foo} if that exists and is set to a non-empty value,
otherwise \code{bar}.  (If it is of the form \code{\$\{foo\}}, the
default is \code{""}.)  This construction can be nested, so \code{bar}
can be of the same form (as in \code{\$\{foo-\$\{bar-blah\}\}}).  Note that
the braces are essential: for example \code{\$HOME} will not be interpreted.

Leading and trailing white space in \code{\var{value}} are stripped.
\code{\var{value}} is then processed in a similar way to a Unix shell:
in particular the outermost level of (single or double) quotes is
stripped, and backslashes are removed except inside quotes.

On systems with sub-architectures (mainly Mac OS X and Windows), the
files \file{Renviron.site} and \file{Rprofile.site} are looked for
first in architecture-specific directories,
e.g. \file{\var{\LinkA{R\_HOME}{R.Rul.HOME}}/etc/i386/Renviron.site}.
And e.g. \file{.Renviron.i386} will be used in preference
to \file{.Renviron}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
The startup options are for \command{Rgui}, \command{Rterm} and
\code{R} but not for \command{Rcmd}: attempting to use
e.g. \option{--vanilla} with the latter will give a warning or error.

Unix versions of \R{} have a file \file{\var{\LinkA{R\_HOME}{R.Rul.HOME}}/etc/Renviron}
which is read very early in the start-up processing.  It contains
environment variables set by \R{} in the configure process, and is not
used on \R{} for Windows.

\command{R CMD check} and \command{R CMD build} do not always read the
standard startup files, but they do always read specific
\samp{Renviron} files such as \file{\textasciitilde{}/.R/check.Renviron},
\file{\textasciitilde{}/.R/build.Renviron} or sub-architecture-specific versions.

If you want \code{\textasciitilde{}/.Renviron} or \code{\textasciitilde{}/.Rprofile} to be ignored by
child \R{} processes (such as those run by \command{R CMD check} and
\command{R CMD build}), set the appropriate environment variable
\env{R\_ENVIRON\_USER} or \env{R\_PROFILE\_USER} to (if possible, which it
is not on Windows) \code{""} or to the name of a non-existent file.

The error action is controlled by error handlers established within
the executing code and by the current default error handler set by
\code{options(error=)}.  The error is first signaled as if using
\code{\LinkA{signalCondition}{signalCondition}()}.  If there are no handlers or if all handlers
return, then the error message is printed (if
\code{options("show.error.messages")} is true) and the default error
handler is used.  The default behaviour (the \code{NULL}
error-handler) in interactive use is to return to the top level
prompt or the top level browser, and in non-interactive use to
(effectively) call \code{\LinkA{q}{q}("no", status=1, runLast=FALSE}).
The default handler stores the error message in a buffer; it can be
retrieved by \code{geterrmessage()}.  It also stores a trace of
the call stack that can be retrieved by \code{\LinkA{traceback}{traceback}()}.

Errors will be truncated to \code{getOption("warning.length")}
characters, default 1000.

If a condition object is supplied it should be the only argument, and
further arguments will be ignored, with a warning.

%
\begin{Details}\relax
The \code{format} and \code{as.character} methods and \code{strftime}
convert objects from the classes \code{"POSIXlt"} and \code{"POSIXct"}
(not \code{strftime}) to character vectors.

\code{strptime} converts character vectors to class \code{"POSIXlt"}:
its input \code{x} is first converted by \code{\LinkA{as.character}{as.character}}.
Each input string is processed as far as necessary for the format
specified: any trailing characters are ignored.

\code{strftime} is a wrapper for \code{format.POSIXlt}, and it and
\code{format.POSIXct} first convert to class \code{"POSIXlt"} by
calling \code{\LinkA{as.POSIXlt}{as.POSIXlt}}.  Note that only that conversion
depends on the time zone.

The usual vector re-cycling rules are applied to \code{x} and
\code{format} so the answer will be of length that of the longer of the
vectors.

Locale-specific conversions to and from character strings are used
where appropriate and available.  This affects the names of the days
and months, the AM/PM indicator (if used) and the separators in
formats such as \code{\%x} and \code{\%X} (via the setting of the
\code{LC\_TIME} locale category).

The details of the formats are system-specific, but the following are
defined by the ISO C99 / POSIX standard for \code{strftime} and are
likely to be widely available.  A \emph{conversion specification} is
introduced by \code{\%}, usually followed by a single letter or
\code{O} or \code{E} and then a single letter.
Any character in the format string not part of a conversion specification
is interpreted literally (and \code{\%\%} gives \code{\%}).  Widely
implemented conversion specifications include
\begin{description}

\item[\code{\%a}] Abbreviated weekday name in the current
locale.  (Also matches full name on input.)
\item[\code{\%A}] Full weekday name in the current locale.  (Also
matches abbreviated name on input.)
\item[\code{\%b}] Abbreviated month name in the current
locale.  (Also matches full name on input.)
\item[\code{\%B}] Full month name in the current locale.  (Also
matches abbreviated name on input.)
\item[\code{\%c}] Date and time.   Locale-specific on output,
\code{"\%a \%b \%e \%H:\%M:\%S \%Y"} on input.
\item[\code{\%d}] Day of the month as decimal number (01--31).
\item[\code{\%H}] Hours as decimal number (00--23).  As a special
exception times such as \samp{24:00:00} are accepted for input,
since ISO 8601 allows these.
\item[\code{\%I}] Hours as decimal number (01--12).
\item[\code{\%j}] Day of year as decimal number (001--366).
\item[\code{\%m}] Month as decimal number (01--12).
\item[\code{\%M}] Minute as decimal number (00--59).
\item[\code{\%p}] AM/PM indicator in the locale.  Used in
conjunction with \code{\%I} and \bold{not} with \code{\%H}.  An
empty string in some locales.
\item[\code{\%S}] Second as decimal number (00--61), allowing for
up to two leap-seconds (but POSIX-compliant implementations
will ignore leap seconds).

\item[\code{\%U}] Week of the year as decimal number (00--53) using
Sunday as the first day 1 of the week (and typically with the
first Sunday of the year as day 1 of week 1).  The US convention.
\item[\code{\%w}] Weekday as decimal number (0--6, Sunday is 0).
\item[\code{\%W}] Week of the year as decimal number (00--53) using
Monday as the first day of week (and typically with the
first Monday of the year as day 1 of week 1).  The UK convention.
\item[\code{\%x}] Date.  Locale-specific on output,
\code{"\%y/\%m/\%d"} on input.
\item[\code{\%X}] Time.  Locale-specific on output,
\code{"\%H:\%M:\%S"} on input.
\item[\code{\%y}] Year without century (00--99).  On input, values
00 to 68 are prefixed by 20 and 69 to 99 by 19 -- that is the
behaviour specified by the 2004 and 2008 POSIX standards, but they do
also say `it is expected that in a future version the
default century inferred from a 2-digit year will change'.
\item[\code{\%Y}] Year with century.  Note that whereas there was no
zero in the original Gregorian calendar, ISO 8601:2004 defines it
to be valid (interpreted as 1BC): see
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(year)}.  Note that the standard
also says that years before 1582 in its calendar should only be used
with agreement of the parties involved.
\item[\code{\%z}] Signed offset in hours and minutes from UTC, so
\code{-0800} is 8 hours behind UTC.
\item[\code{\%Z}] (output only.) Time zone as a character
string (empty if not available).

\end{description}

Where leading zeros are shown they will be used on output but are
optional on input.

Note that when \code{\%z} or \code{\%Z} is used for output with an
object with an assigned timezone an attempt is made to use the values
for that timezone --- but it is not guaranteed to succeed.

Also defined in the current standards but less widely implemented
(e.g. not for output on Windows) are
\begin{description}

\item[\code{\%C}] Century (00--99): the integer part of the year
divided by 100.
\item[\code{\%D}] Date format such as \code{\%m/\%d/\%y}: ISO C99
says it should be that exact format.
\item[\code{\%e}] Day of the month as decimal number (1--31), with
a leading space for a single-digit number.
\item[\code{\%F}] Equivalent to \%Y-\%m-\%d (the ISO 8601 date
format).
\item[\code{\%g}] The last two digits of the week-based year
(see \code{\%V}).  (Accepted but ignored on input.)
\item[\code{\%G}] The week-based year (see \code{\%V}) as a decimal
number.  (Accepted but ignored on input.)
\item[\code{\%h}] Equivalent to \code{\%b}.
\item[\code{\%k}] The 24-hour clock time with single digits preceded
by a blank.
\item[\code{\%l}] The 12-hour clock time with single digits preceded
by a blank.
\item[\code{\%n}] Newline on output, arbitrary whitespace on input.
\item[\code{\%r}] The 12-hour clock time (using the locale's AM or PM).
\item[\code{\%R}] Equivalent to \code{\%H:\%M}.
\item[\code{\%t}] Tab on output, arbitrary whitespace on input.
\item[\code{\%T}] Equivalent to \code{\%H:\%M:\%S}.
\item[\code{\%u}] Weekday as a decimal number (1--7, Monday is 1).
\item[\code{\%V}] Week of the year as decimal number (00--53) as
defined in ISO 8601.
If the week (starting on Monday) containing 1 January has four or
more days in the new year, then it is considered week 1.  Otherwise, it
is the last week of the previous year, and the next week is week
1.  (Accepted but ignored on input.)

\end{description}

For output there are also \code{\%O[dHImMUVwWy]} which may emit
numbers in an alternative locale-dependent format (e.g. roman
numerals), and \code{\%E[cCyYxX]} which can use an alternative
`era' (e.g. a different religious calendar).  Which of these
are supported is OS-dependent.  These are accepted for input, but with
the standard interpretation.

Specific to \R{} is \code{\%OSn}, which for output gives the seconds
truncated to \code{0 <= n <= 6} decimal places (and if \code{\%OS} is
not followed by a digit, it uses the setting of
\code{\LinkA{getOption}{getOption}("digits.secs")}, or if that is unset, \code{n =
  3}).  Further, for \code{strptime} \code{\%OS} will input seconds
including fractional seconds.  Note that \code{\%S} ignores (and not
rounds) fractional parts on output.

The behaviour of other conversion specifications (and even if other
character sequences commencing with \code{\%} \emph{are} conversion
specifications) is system-specific.
For output on Windows, a conversion specification is \code{\%}
optionally followed by \code{\#} and then by a single letter.  Any
conversion specification which is unimplemented is ignored.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
The \code{format} methods and \code{strftime} return character vectors
representing the time.  \code{NA} times are returned as \code{NA\_character\_}.

\code{strptime} turns character representations into an object of
class \code{"\LinkA{POSIXlt}{POSIXlt}"}.  The timezone is used to set the
\code{isdst} component and to set the \code{"tzone"} attribute if
\code{tz != ""}.  If the specified time is invalid (for example
\samp{"2010-02-30 08:00"}) all the components of the result are
\code{NA}.  (NB: this does means exactly what it says -- if it is an
invalid time, not just a time that does not exist in some timezone.)

\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
The default formats follow the rules of the ISO 8601 international
standard which expresses a day as \code{"2001-02-28"} and a time as
\code{"14:01:02"} using leading zeroes as here.  The ISO form uses no
space to separate dates and times.

For \code{strptime} the input string need not specify the date
completely: it is assumed that unspecified seconds, minutes or hours
are zero, and an unspecified year, month or day is the current one.

If the timezone specified is invalid on your system, what happens is
system-specific but it will probably be ignored.

OS facilities will probably not print years before 1 CE (aka 1 AD)
correctly.

Remember that in most timezones some times do not occur and some occur
twice because of transitions to/from summer time.  \code{strptime}
does not validate such times (it does not assume a specific timezone),
but conversion by \code{\LinkA{as.POSIXct}{as.POSIXct}}) will do so.  Conversion by
\code{strftime} and formatting/printing uses OS facilities and may
(and does on Windows) return nonsensical results for non-existent
times at DST transitions.

\HeaderA{strsplit}{Split the Elements of a Character Vector}{strsplit}
\keyword{character}{strsplit}
%
\begin{Description}\relax
Split the elements of a character vector \code{x} into substrings
according to the matches to substring \code{split} within them.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
strsplit(x, split, fixed = FALSE, perl = FALSE, useBytes = FALSE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] 
character vector, each element of which is to be split.  Other
inputs, including a factor, will give an error.

\item[\code{split}] 
character vector (or object which can be coerced to such)
containing \LinkA{regular expression}{regular expression}(s) (unless \code{fixed = TRUE})
to use for splitting.  If empty matches occur, in particular if
\code{split} has length 0, \code{x} is split into single characters.
If \code{split} has length greater than 1, it is re-cycled along
\code{x}.

\item[\code{fixed}] 
logical.  If \code{TRUE} match \code{split} exactly, otherwise
use regular expressions.  Has priority over \code{perl}.

\item[\code{perl}] logical.  Should perl-compatible regexps be used?
\item[\code{useBytes}] logical.  If \code{TRUE} the matching is done
byte-by-byte rather than character-by-character, and inputs with
marked encodings are not converted.  This is forced (with a warning)
if any input is found which is marked as \code{"bytes"}.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
Argument \code{split} will be coerced to character, so
you will see uses with \code{split = NULL} to mean
\code{split = character(0)}, including in the examples below.

Note that splitting into single characters can be done \emph{via}
\code{split = character(0)} or \code{split = ""}; the two are
equivalent.  The definition of `character' here depends on the
locale: in a single-byte locale it is a byte, and in a multi-byte
locale it is the unit represented by a `wide character' (almost
always a Unicode point).

A missing value of \code{split} does not split the corresponding
element(s) of \code{x} at all.

The algorithm applied to each input string is
\begin{alltt}
    repeat \{
        if the string is empty
            break.
        if there is a match
            add the string to the left of the match to the output.
            remove the match and all to the left of it.
        else
            add the string to the output.
            break.
    \}
\end{alltt}

Note that this means that if there is a match at the beginning of a
(non-empty) string, the first element of the output is \code{""}, but
if there is a match at the end of the string, the output is the same
as with the match removed.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
A list of the same length as \code{x}, the \code{i}-th element of which
contains the vector of splits of \code{x[i]}.

If any element of \code{x} or \code{split} is declared to be in UTF-8
(see \code{\LinkA{Encoding}{Encoding}}), all non-ASCII character strings in the
result will be in UTF-8 and have their encoding declared as UTF-8.  As
from \R{} 2.10.0, for \code{perl = TRUE, useBytes = FALSE} all non-ASCII
strings in a multibyte locale are translated to UTF-8.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
Prior to \R{} 2.11.0 there was an argument \code{extended} which could
be used to select `basic' regular expressions: this was often
used when \code{fixed = TRUE} would be preferable.  In the actual
implementation (as distinct from the POSIX standard) the only
difference was that \samp{?}, \samp{+}, \samp{\{}, \samp{|}, \samp{(},
and \samp{)} were not interpreted as metacharacters.

Conversion is based on the C library function \code{strtol}.

For the default \code{base = 0L}, the base chosen from the string
representation of that element of \code{x}, so different elements can
have different bases (see the first example).  The standard C rules
for choosing the base are that octal constants (prefix \code{0} not
followed by \code{x} or \code{X}) and hexadecimal constants (prefix
\code{0x} or \code{0X}) are interpreted as base \code{8} and
\code{16}; all other strings are interpreted as base \code{10}.

For a base greater than \code{10}, letters \code{a} to \code{z} (or
\code{A} to \code{Z}) are used to represent \code{10} to \code{35}.
\end{Details}

\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
This is a generic function, with methods supplied for matrices, data
frames and vectors (including lists).  Packages and users can add
further methods.

For ordinary vectors, the result is simply
\code{x[subset \& !is.na(subset)]}.

For data frames, the \code{subset} argument works on the rows.  Note
that \code{subset} will be evaluated in the data frame, so columns can
be referred to (by name) as variables in the expression (see the examples).

The \code{select} argument exists only for the methods for data frames
and matrices.  It works by first replacing column names in the
selection expression with the corresponding column numbers in the data
frame and then using the resulting integer vector to index the
columns.  This allows the use of the standard indexing conventions so
that for example ranges of columns can be specified easily, or single
columns can be dropped (see the examples).

The \code{drop} argument is passed on to the indexing method for
matrices and data frames: note that the default for matrices is
different from that for indexing.

Factors may have empty levels after subsetting; unused levels are
not automatically removed.  See \code{\LinkA{droplevels}{droplevels}} for a way to
drop all unused levels from a data frame.

\begin{Section}{Warning}
This is a convenience function intended for use interactively.  For
programming it is better to use the standard subsetting functions like
\code{\LinkA{[}{[}}, and in particular the non-standard evaluation of
argument \code{subset} can have unanticipated consequences.

%
\begin{Description}\relax
\code{substitute} returns the parse tree for the (unevaluated)
expression \code{expr}, substituting any variables bound in
\code{env}.

\code{quote} simply returns its argument. The argument is not evaluated
and can be any R expression.

\code{enquote} is a simple one-line utility which transforms a call of
the form \code{Foo(....)} into the call \code{quote(Foo(....))}.  This
is typically used to protect a \code{\LinkA{call}{call}} from early evaluation.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
substitute(expr, env)
quote(expr)
enquote(cl)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{expr}] any syntactically valid \R{} expression
\item[\code{cl}] a \code{\LinkA{call}{call}}, i.e., an \R{} object of
\code{\LinkA{class}{class}} (and \code{\LinkA{mode}{mode}}) \code{"call"}.
\item[\code{env}] an environment or a list object.  Defaults to the
current evaluation environment.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The typical use of \code{substitute} is to create informative labels
for data sets and plots.
The \code{myplot} example below shows a simple use of this facility.
It uses the functions \code{\LinkA{deparse}{deparse}} and \code{substitute}
to create labels for a plot which are character string versions
of the actual arguments to the function \code{myplot}.

Substitution takes place by examining each component of the parse tree
as follows: If it is not a bound symbol in \code{env}, it is
unchanged.  If it is a promise object, i.e., a formal argument to a
function or explicitly created using \code{\LinkA{delayedAssign}{delayedAssign}()},
the expression slot of the promise replaces the symbol.  If it is an
ordinary variable, its value is substituted, unless \code{env} is
\code{\LinkA{.GlobalEnv}{.GlobalEnv}} in which case the symbol is left unchanged.

Both \code{quote} and \code{substitute} are `special'
\LinkA{primitive}{primitive} functions which do not evaluate their arguments.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
The \code{\LinkA{mode}{mode}} of the result is generally \code{"call"} but
may in principle be any type. In particular, single-variable
expressions have mode \code{"name"} and constants have the
appropriate base mode.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
\code{substitute} works on a purely lexical basis.  There is no
guarantee that the resulting expression makes any sense.

Substituting and quoting often cause confusion when the argument is
\code{expression(...)}.  The result is a call to the
\code{\LinkA{expression}{expression}} constructor function and needs to be evaluated
with \code{\LinkA{eval}{eval}} to give the actual expression object.

\begin{Description}\relax
Extract or replace substrings in a character vector.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
substr(x, start, stop)
substring(text, first, last = 1000000L)
substr(x, start, stop) <- value
substring(text, first, last = 1000000L) <- value
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x, text}] a character vector.
\item[\code{start, first}] integer.  The first element to be replaced.
\item[\code{stop, last}] integer.  The last element to be replaced.
\item[\code{value}] a character vector, recycled if necessary.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{substring} is compatible with S, with \code{first} and
\code{last} instead of \code{start} and \code{stop}.
For vector arguments, it expands the arguments cyclically to the
length of the longest \emph{provided} none are of zero length.

When extracting, if \code{start} is larger than the string length then
\code{""} is returned.

For the extraction functions, \code{x} or \code{text} will be
converted to a character vector by \code{\LinkA{as.character}{as.character}} if it is not
already one.

For the replacement functions, if \code{start} is larger than the
string length then no replacement is done.  If the portion to be
replaced is longer than the replacement string, then only the
portion the length of the string is replaced.

If any argument is an \code{NA} element, the corresponding element of
the answer is \code{NA}.

Elements of the result will be have the encoding declared as that of
the current locale (see \code{\LinkA{Encoding}{Encoding}} if the corresponding
input had a declared Latin-1 or UTF-8 encoding and the current locale
is either Latin-1 or UTF-8.

If an input element has declared \code{"bytes"} encoding, the
subsetting is done in units of bytes not characters.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
For \code{substr}, a character vector of the same length and with the
same attributes as \code{x} (after possible coercion).

For \code{substring}, a character vector of length the longest of the
arguments.  This will have names taken from \code{x} (if it has any
after coercion, repeated as needed), and other attributes copied from
\code{x} if it is the longest of the arguments).

Elements of \code{x} with a declared encoding (see
\code{\LinkA{Encoding}{Encoding}}) will be returned with the same encoding.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
The S4 version of \code{substring<-} ignores \code{last}; this version
does not.

These functions are often used with \code{\LinkA{nchar}{nchar}} to truncate a
display.  That does not really work (you want to limit the width, not
the number of characters, so it would be better to use
\code{\LinkA{strtrim}{strtrim}}), but at least make sure you use the default
\code{nchar(type="c")}.

If \code{na.rm} is \code{FALSE} an \code{NA} or \code{NaN} value in
any of the arguments will cause a value of \code{NA} or \code{NaN} to
be returned, otherwise \code{NA} and \code{NaN} values are ignored.

Logical true values are regarded as one, false values as zero.

\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
For \code{\LinkA{factor}{factor}}s, the frequency of the first \code{maxsum - 1}
most frequent levels is shown, and the less frequent levels are
summarized in \code{"(Others)"} (resulting in at most \code{maxsum}
frequencies).

of particular methods which summarize the results produced by
\code{\LinkA{lm}{lm}} and \code{\LinkA{glm}{glm}}.

\begin{Value}
The form of the value returned by \code{summary} depends on the
class of its argument.  See the documentation of the particular
methods for details of what is produced by that method.

The default method returns an object of class
\code{c("summaryDefault", "\LinkA{table}{table}")} which has a specialized
\code{print} method.  The \code{\LinkA{factor}{factor}} method returns an
integer vector.

The matrix and data frame methods return a matrix of class
\code{"\LinkA{table}{table}"}, obtained by applying \code{summary} to each
column and collating the results.

\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] a numeric, logical or complex matrix whose SVD decomposition

%
\begin{Details}\relax
The singular value decomposition plays an important role in many
statistical techniques.  \code{svd} and \code{La.svd} provide two
slightly different interfaces.

Computing the singular vectors is the slow part for large matrices.
The computation will be more efficient if \code{nu <= min(n, p)} and
\code{nv <= min(n, p)}, and even more efficient if one or both are zero.

Unsuccessful results from the underlying LAPACK code will result in an
error giving a positive error code (most often \code{1}): these can
only be interpreted by detailed study of the FORTRAN code but mean
that the algorithm failed to converge.

\eqn{\bold{D}}{} is a diagonal matrix with the singular
values \eqn{D_{ii}}{}.  Equivalently, \eqn{\bold{D = U' X V}}{},
which is verified in the examples, below.

\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{d}] a vector containing the singular values of \code{x}, of

\item[\code{v}] a matrix whose columns contain the right singular vectors of
\code{x}, present if \code{nv > 0}.  Dimension \code{c(p, nv)}.

\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{EXPR}] an expression evaluating to a number or a character

returned: thus if the first argument is \code{3} then the fourth
argument is evaluated and returned.

If \code{EXPR} evaluates to a character string then that string is
matched (exactly)to the names of the elements in \code{...}.  If
there is a match then that element is evaluated unless it is missing,
in which case the next non-missing element is evaluated, so for
example \code{switch("cc", a=1, cc=, cd=, d=2)} evaluates to \code{2}.
If there is more than one match, the first matching element is used.
In the case of no match, if there is a unnamed element of \code{...}
its value is returned.  (If there is more than one such argument 
an error is returned.  Before \R{} 2.13.0 the first one would have
been used.)

The first argument is always taken to be \code{EXPR}: if it is named
its name must (partially) match.

This is implemented as a \LinkA{primitive}{primitive} function that only evaluates
its first argument and one other if one is selected.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
The value of one of the elements of \code{...}, or \code{NULL},
invisibly (whenever no element is selected).

The result has the visibility (see \code{\LinkA{invisible}{invisible}}) of the
element evaluated.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{Warning}
Before \R{} 2.11.0 it was necessary to avoid partial matching: an
alternative \code{E = foo} matched the first argument \code{EXPR}
unless that was named.

It is possible to write calls to \code{switch} that can be confusing
and may not work in the same way in earlier versions of \R{}.  For
compatibility (and clarity), always have \code{EXPR} as the first
argument, naming it if partial matching is a possibility.  For the
character-string form, have a single unnamed argument as the default
after the named values.

\begin{Description}\relax
Outlines \R{} syntax and gives the precedence of operators.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The following unary and binary operators are defined.  They are listed
in precedence groups, from highest to lowest.

\Tabular{ll}{
\code{:: :::}& access variables in a namespace\\{}
\code{\$ @}& component / slot extraction\\{}
\code{[ [[}& indexing\\{}
\code{\textasciicircum{}}& exponentiation (right to left)\\{}
\code{- +}& unary minus and plus\\{}
\code{:}& sequence operator\\{}
\code{\%any\%}& special operators (including \code{\%\%} and \code{\%/\%})\\{}
\code{* /}& multiply, divide\\{}
\code{+ -}& (binary) add, subtract\\{}
\code{< > <= >= == !=}& ordering and comparison\\{}
\code{!}& negation\\{}
\code{\&  \&\&}& and\\{}
\code{| ||}& or\\{}
\code{\textasciitilde{}}& as in formulae\\{}
\code{-> ->{}>}& rightwards assignment\\{}
\code{<- <{}<-}& assignment (right to left)\\{}
\code{=}& assignment (right to left)\\{}
\code{?}& help (unary and binary)\\{}
}
Within an expression operators of equal precedence are evaluated
from left to right except where indicated.  (Note that \code{=} is not
necessarily an operator.)

The binary operators \code{::}, \code{:::}, \code{\$} and \code{@} require
names or string constants on the right hand side, and the first two
also require them on the left.

The links in the \bold{See Also} section cover most other aspects of
the basic syntax.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
There are substantial precedence differences between \R{} and S.  In
particular, in S \code{?} has the same precedence as (binary) \code{+ -}
and \code{\& \&\& | ||} have equal precedence.

%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] a character vector, or \code{NULL}.
\item[\code{unset}] a character string.
\item[\code{names}] logical: should the result be named?  If \code{NA} (the
default) single-element results are not named whereas multi-element
results are.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
Both arguments will be coerced to character if necessary.

Setting \code{unset = NA} will enable unset variables and those set to
the value \code{""} to be distinguished, \emph{if the OS does}.  POSIX
requires the OS to distinguish, and all known current \R{} platforms do.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
A vector of the same length as \code{x}, with (if \code{names ==
  TRUE}) the variable names as its \code{names} attribute.  Each element
holds the value of the environment variable named by the corresponding
component of \code{x} (or the value of \code{unset} if no environment
variable with that name was found).

On most platforms \code{Sys.getenv()} will return a named vector
giving the values of all the environment variables, sorted in the
current locale.  It may be confused by names containing \code{=} which
some platforms allow but POSIX does not.  (Windows is such a platform:
there names including \code{=} are truncated just before the first
\code{=}.)

Argument \code{names} was introduced in \R{} 2.13.0 to avoid needing the
common use of \code{as.vector(Sys.getenv())}.

%
\begin{Description}\relax
Function to do wildcard expansion (also known as `globbing') on
file paths.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
Sys.glob(paths, dirmark = FALSE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{paths}] character vector of patterns for relative or absolute
filepaths.  Missing values will be ignored.
\item[\code{dirmark}] logical: should matches to directories from patterns
that do not already end in \code{/}
or \code{\bsl{}}
have a slash appended?  May not be supported on all platforms.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The \code{glob} system call is not part of Windows, and we supply a
partial emulation.

Wildcards are \code{*} (match zero or more characters) and \code{?} (match
a single character).  If a filename starts with \code{.} this must be
matched explicitly.

In addition, \code{[} begins a character class.  If the first
character in \code{[...]} is not \code{!}, this is a character class
which matches a single character against any of the characters
specified.  The class cannot be empty, so \code{]} can be included
provided it is first.  If the first character is \code{!}, the
character class matches a single character which is \emph{none} of the
specified characters.

Character classes can include ranges such as \code{[A-Z]}: include
\code{-} as a character by having it first or last in a class.  (In the
current implementation ranges are in numeric order of Unicode points.)

One can remove the special meaning of \code{?}, \code{*}  and
\code{[} by preceding them by a backslash (except within a
character class).  Note that on Windows \code{?} and \code{*} are not
valid in file names, so this is mainly for consistency with other
platforms.

File paths in Windows are interpreted with separator \code{\bsl{}} or
\code{/}.  Paths with a drive but relative (such as \code{c:foo\bsl{}bar})
are tricky, but an attempt is made to handle them correctly.  An
attempt is made to handle UNC paths starting with a double
backslash. UTF-8-encoded paths not valid in the current locale can be
used.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
A character vector of matched file paths.  The order is
system-specific (but in the order of the elements of \code{paths}): it
is normally collated in either the current locale or in byte (ASCII)
order; however, on Windows collation is in the order of Unicode
points.

Directory errors are normally ignored, so the matches are to
accessible file paths (but not necessarily accessible files).

This function is not implemented on all \R{} platforms, and returns

system calls.  (Under Windows, it is obtained by Windows system
calls and the last three values are the same.)

\code{Sys.info()} returns details of the platform \R{} is running on,
whereas \code{\LinkA{R.version}{R.version}} gives details of the platform \R{} was
built on: they may well be different.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
A character vector with fields
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{sysname}] The operating system.
\item[\code{release}] The OS release.
\item[\code{version}] The OS version.
\item[\code{nodename}] A name by which the machine is known on the network (if
any).
\item[\code{machine}] A concise description of the hardware.
\item[\code{login}] The user's login name, or \code{"unknown"} if it cannot be
ascertained.
\item[\code{user}] The name of the real user ID, or \code{"unknown"} if it
cannot be ascertained.
\item[\code{effective\_user}] The name of the effective user ID, or
\code{"unknown"} if it
cannot be ascertained.  This may differ from the real user in
`set-user-ID' processes.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
The meaning of OS `release' and `version' is
system-dependent and there is no guarantee that the node or
login or user names will be what you might reasonably expect.
(In particular on some Linux distributions the login name is unknown
from sessions with re-directed inputs.)

The use of alternatives such as \code{system("whoami")} is not
portable: the POSIX command \code{system("id")} is much more portable
on Unix-alikes, provided only the POSIX options are used (and not the
many GNU extensions).

\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{which}] the frame number if non-negative, the number of frames
to go back if negative.
\item[\code{n}] the number of generations to go back.  (See the
`Details' section.)
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{\LinkA{.GlobalEnv}{.GlobalEnv}} is given number 0 in the list of frames.
Each subsequent function evaluation increases the frame stack by 1
and the call, function definition and the environment for evaluation
of that function are returned by \code{sys.call}, \code{sys.function}
and \code{sys.frame} with the appropriate index.

\code{sys.call}, \code{sys.frame} and \code{sys.function} accept
integer values for the argument \code{which}.  Non-negative values of
\code{which} are frame numbers whereas negative values are
counted back from the frame number of the current evaluation.

The parent frame of a function evaluation is the environment in which
the function was called.  It is not necessarily numbered one less than
the frame number of the current evaluation, nor is it the environment
within which the function was defined.  \code{sys.parent} returns the
number of the parent frame if \code{n} is 1 (the default), the
grandparent if \code{n} is 2, and so on.  See also the `Note'.

\code{sys.nframe} returns an integer, the number of the current frame
as described in the first paragraph.

\code{sys.calls} and \code{sys.frames} give a pairlist of all the
active calls and frames, respectively, and \code{sys.parents} returns
an integer vector of indices of the parent frames of each of those
frames.

Notice that even though the \code{sys.}\emph{xxx} functions (except
\code{sys.status}) are interpreted, their contexts are not counted nor
are they reported.  There is no access to them.

\code{sys.status()} returns a list with components \code{sys.calls},
\code{sys.parents} and \code{sys.frames}, the results of calls to
those three functions (which this will include the call to
\code{sys.status}: see the first example).

\code{sys.on.exit()} returns the expression stored for use by
\code{\LinkA{on.exit}{on.exit}} in the function currently being evaluated.
(Note that this differs from S, which returns a list of expressions
for the current frame and its parents.)

\code{parent.frame(n)} is a convenient shorthand for
\code{sys.frame(sys.parent(n))} (implemented slightly more efficiently).
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{sys.call} returns a call, \code{sys.function} a function
definition, and \code{sys.frame} and \code{parent.frame} return an
environment.

For the other functions, see the `Details' section.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
Strictly, \code{sys.parent} and \code{parent.frame} refer to the
\emph{context} of the parent interpreted function.  So internal
functions (which may or may not set contexts and so may or may not
appear on the call stack) may not be counted, and S3 methods can also do
surprising things.

Beware of the effect of lazy evaluation: these two functions look at
the call stack at the time they are evaluated, not at the time they
are called.  Passing calls to them as function arguments is unlikely to
be a good idea.

\begin{Details}\relax
Non-standard \R{} names must be quoted in \code{Sys.setenv}: see the
examples.  Most platforms (and POSIX) do not allow names containing
\code{"="}.  Windows does, but the facilities provided by \R{} may not
handle these correctly so they should be avoided.  Most platforms
allow setting an environment variable to \code{""}, but Windows does
not, and there \code{Sys.setenv(FOO="")} unsets \env{FOO}.

There may be system-specific limits on the maximum length of the values
of individual environment variables or of all environment variables.
Windows has a limit of 32,767 characters on the environment block, and
\code{cmd.exe} has a limit of 2047 (Windows 2000) or 8192 characters
(XP and later) for each value.
\end{Details}

\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{time}] The time interval to suspend execution for, in seconds.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
Using this function allows \R{} to be given very low priority and hence
not to interfere with more important foreground tasks.  A typical use
is to allow a process launched from \R{} to set itself up and read its
input files before \R{} execution is resumed.

The intention is that this function suspends execution of \R{}
expressions but wakes the process up often enough to respond to GUI
events, typically every 0.5 seconds.

There is no guarantee that the process will sleep for the whole of the
specified interval, and it may well take slightly longer in real time
to resume execution.  The resolution of the time interval is
system-dependent, but will normally be down to 0.02 secs or better.
(On modern Unix-alikes it will be better than 1ms.)

The default value \code{NULL} corresponds to evaluation in the base
environment.  This is probably not what you want; you should
typically supply an explicit \code{envir} argument.
\item[\code{chdir}] logical; if \code{TRUE}, the \R{} working directory is
changed to the directory containing \code{file} for evaluating.
\item[\code{keep.source}] logical.  If \code{TRUE}, functions keep
their source including comments, see

\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
Sys.which(names)

\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{names}] Character vector of names or paths of possible executables.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The system command \command{which} reports on the full path names of
an executable (including an executable script) as would be executed by
a shell, accepting either absolute paths or looking on the path.

On Windows an `executable' is a file with extension
\file{.exe}, \file{.com}, \file{.cmd} or \file{.bat}.  Such files need
not actually be executable, but they are what \code{\LinkA{system}{system}}
tries.

On a Unix-alike the full path to \code{which} (usually
\file{/usr/bin/which}) is found when \R{} is installed.

Arguments containing spaces or other metacharacters need to be escaped
as they would be for a shell: for example Windows paths containing
spaces need to be enclosed in double quotes.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
A character vector of the same length as \code{names}, named by
\code{names}.  The elements are either the full path to the
executable  or some indication that no executable of that name was
found.  Typically the indication is \code{""}, but this does depend on
the OS (and the known exceptions are changed to \code{""}).

On Windows the paths will be short paths (8+3 components, no spaces)
with \code{\bsl{}} as the path delimiter.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
Except on Windows this calls the system command \command{which}: since
that is not part of e.g. the POSIX standards, exactly what it does is

of \command{csh} aliases.

%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{command}] the system command to be invoked, as a character string.
\item[\code{intern}] a logical (not \code{NA}) which indicates whether to
capture the output of the command as an \R{} character vector.
\item[\code{ignore.stdout, ignore.stderr}] a logical (not \code{NA})
indicating whether messages written to \file{stdout} or
\file{stderr} should be ignored.
\item[\code{wait}] a logical (not \code{NA}) indicating whether the \R{}
interpreter should wait for the command to finish, or run it
asynchronously.  This will be ignored (and the interpreter will
always wait) if \code{intern = TRUE}.
\item[\code{input}] if a character vector is supplied, this is copied one
string per line to a temporary file, and the standard input of
\code{command} is redirected to the file.
\item[\code{show.output.on.console}] logical (not \code{NA}), indicates
whether to capture the output of the command and show it on the \R{}
console (not used by \code{Rterm}, which shows the output in the
terminal unless \code{wait} is false).
\item[\code{minimized}] logical (not \code{NA}), indicates whether a
command window should be displayed initially as a minimized window.
\item[\code{invisible}] logical (not \code{NA}), indicates whether a
command window should be visible on the screen.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{command} is parsed as a command plus arguments separated by spaces.
So if the path to the command (or an argument) contains
spaces, it must be quoted e.g. by \code{\LinkA{shQuote}{shQuote}}.
Only double quotes are allowed on Windows: see the examples.  (Note: a
Windows path name cannot contain a double quote, so we do not need to
worry about escaping embedded quotes.)

\code{command} must be an executable (extensions \file{.exe},
\file{.com}) or a batch file (extensions \file{.cmd} and \file{.bat}):
these extensions are tried in turn if none is supplied.)  This means
that redirection, pipes, DOS internal commands, \dots cannot be used:
see \code{\LinkA{shell}{shell}}.

The search path for \code{command} may be system-dependent: it will
include the \R{} \file{bin} directory, the working directory and the
Windows system directories before \env{PATH}.

The ordering of arguments after the first two has changed from time to
time: it is recommended to name all arguments after the first.

There are many pitfalls in using \code{system} to ascertain if a
command can be run --- \code{\LinkA{Sys.which}{Sys.which}} is more suitable.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
If \code{intern = TRUE}, a character vector giving the output of the
command, one line per character string.  (Output lines of more than
8095 bytes will be split.)  If the command could not be run an \R{}
error is generated.
Under the \code{Rgui} console \code{intern = TRUE} also captures
\code{stderr} unless \code{ignore.stderr = TRUE}.
If \code{command} runs but gives a non-zero exit status this will be
reported with a warning and in the attribute \code{"status"} of the
result: an attribute \code{"errmsg"} may also be available

If \code{intern = FALSE}, the return value is an error code (\code{0}
for success), given the invisible attribute (so needs to be printed
explicitly).  If the command could not be run for any reason, the
value is \code{127}.  Otherwise if \code{wait = TRUE} the value is the
exit status returned by the command, and if \code{wait = FALSE} it is
\code{0} (the conventional success value).
Some Windows commands return out-of-range status values
(e.g. \code{-1}) and so only the bottom 16 bits of the value are used.

If \code{intern = FALSE, wait = TRUE, show.output.on.console = TRUE} the
\file{stdout} and \file{stderr} (unless \code{ignore.stdout = TRUE} or
\code{ignore.stderr = TRUE}) output from a command that is a
`console application' should appear in the \R{} console
(\code{Rgui}) or the window running \R{} (\code{Rterm}).

Not all Windows executables properly respect redirection of output, or
may only do so from a console application such as \code{Rterm} and not
from \code{Rgui}: for example, \file{fc.exe} was among these in the past,
but we have had more success recently.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{Interaction with the command}
Precisely what is seen by the user depends on the optional parameters,
whether \code{Rgui} or \code{Rterm} is being used, and whether a
console command or GUI application is run by the command.

By default nothing will be seen in either front-end until the command
finishes and the output is displayed.

For console commands \code{Rgui} will open a new `console', so
if \code{invisible = FALSE}, a commands window will appear for the
duration of the command.  For \code{Rterm} a separate commands window
will appear for console applications only if \code{wait = FALSE} and
\code{invisible = FALSE}.

GUI applications will not display in either front-end unless
\code{invisible} is false.

It is possible to interrupt a running command being waited for from
the keyboard (using the \samp{Esc} key in \code{Rgui} or \samp{Ctrl-C}
in \code{Rterm}) or from the \code{Rgui} menu: this should at least
return control to the \R{} console.  \R{} will attempt to shut down the
process cleanly, but may need to force it to terminate, with the
possibility of losing unsaved work, etc.

Do not try to run console applications that require user
input from \code{Rgui} setting \code{intern = TRUE} or
\code{show.output.on.console = TRUE}.  They will not work.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Section}{Differences between Unix and Windows}
How processes are launched differs fundamentally between Windows and
Unix-alike operating systems, as do the higher-level OS functions on
which this \R{} function is built.  So it should not be surprising that
there are many differences between OSes in how \code{system} behaves.
For the benefit of programmers, the more important ones are summarized
in this section.

\begin{itemize}

\item The most important difference is that on a Unix-alike
\code{system} launches a shell which then runs \code{command}.  On
Windows the command is run directly -- use \code{shell} for an
interface which runs \code{command} \emph{via} a shell (by default
the Windows shell \command{cmd.exe}, which has many differences from
the POSIX shell).

This means that it cannot be assumed that redirection or piping will
work in \code{system} (redirection sometimes does, but we have seen
cases where it stopped working after a Windows security patch), and
\code{\LinkA{system2}{system2}} (or \code{shell}) must be used on Windows.

\item What happens to \code{stdout} and \code{stderr} when not
captured depends on how \R{} is running: Windows batch commands behave
like a Unix-alike, but from the Windows GUI they are
generally lost.  \code{system(intern=TRUE)} captures \file{stderr}
when run from the Windows GUI console unless \code{ignore.stderr =
      TRUE}.

\item The behaviour on error is different in subtle ways (and has
differed between \R{} versions).

\item The quoting conventions for \code{command} differ, but
\code{\LinkA{shQuote}{shQuote}} is a portable interface.

\item Arguments \code{show.output.on.console}, \code{minimized},
\code{invisible} only do something on Windows (and are most relevant
to \command{Rgui} there).

\begin{Description}\relax
\code{system2} invokes the OS command specified by \code{command}.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
system2(command, args = character(),
        stdout = "", stderr = "", stdin = "", input = NULL,
        env = character(),
        wait = TRUE, minimized = FALSE, invisible = TRUE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{command}] the system command to be invoked, as a character string.
\item[\code{args}] a character vector of arguments to \command{command}.
\item[\code{stdout, stderr}] where output to \file{stdout} or
\file{stderr} should be sent.  Possible values are \code{""}, to the \R{}
console (the default), \code{NULL} or \code{FALSE} (discard output),
\code{TRUE} (capture the output in a character vector) or a
character string naming a file.
\item[\code{stdin}] should input be diverted?  \code{""} means the default,
alternatively a character string naming a file.  Ignored
if \code{input} is supplied.
\item[\code{input}] if a character vector is supplied, this is copied one
string per line to a temporary file, and the standard input of
\code{command} is redirected to the file.
\item[\code{env}] character vector of name=value strings to set environment
variables.
\item[\code{wait}] a logical (not \code{NA}) indicating whether the \R{}
interpreter should wait for the command to finish, or run it
asynchronously.  This will be ignored (and the interpreter will
always wait) if \code{stdout = TRUE}.
\item[\code{minimized}] logical (not \code{NA}), indicates whether the
command window should be displayed initially as a minimized window.
\item[\code{invisible}] logical (not \code{NA}), indicates whether the
command window should be visible on the screen.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
Unlike \code{\LinkA{system}{system}}, \code{command} is always quoted by
\code{\LinkA{shQuote}{shQuote}}, so it must be a single command without arguments.

For details of how \code{command} is found see \code{\LinkA{system}{system}}.

On Windows, \code{env} is currently only supported for commands such
as \command{R} and \command{make} which accept environment variables on
their command line.

Some Unix commands (such as \code{ls}) change their output depending
on whether they think it is redirected: \code{stdout = TRUE} uses a
pipe whereas \code{stdout = "some\_file\_name"} uses redirection.

Because of the way it is implemented, on a Unix-alike \code{stderr =
    TRUE} implies \code{stdout = TRUE}: a warning is given if this is
not what was specified.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
  
If \code{stdout = TRUE} or \code{stderr = TRUE}, a character vector
giving the output of the command, one line per character string.
(Output lines of more than 8095 bytes will be split.)  If the command
could not be run an \R{} error is generated.  If \code{command} runs but
gives a non-zero exit status this will be reported with a warning and
in the attribute \code{"status"} of the result: an attribute
\code{"errmsg"} may also be available

In other cases, the return value is an error code (\code{0}
for success), given the invisible attribute (so needs to be printed
explicitly).  If the command could not be run for any reason, the
value is \code{127}.  Otherwise if \code{wait = TRUE} the value is the
exit status returned by the command, and if \code{wait = FALSE} it is
\code{0} (the conventional success value).
Some Windows commands return out-of-range status values
(e.g. \code{-1}) and so only the bottom 16 bits of the value are used.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
\code{system2} is a more portable and flexible interface than
\code{\LinkA{system}{system}}, introduced in \R{} 2.12.0.  It allows redirection
of output without needing to invoke a shell on Windows, a portable way
to set environment variables for the execution of \code{command}, and
finer control over the redirection of \code{stdout} and \code{stderr}.
Conversely, \code{system} (and \code{shell} on Windows) allows the
invocation of arbitrary command lines.

There is no guarantee that if \code{stdout} and \code{stderr} are both
\code{TRUE} or the same file that the two streams will be interleaved
in order.  This depends on both the buffering used by the command and
the OS.

\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{...}] one or more objects which can be interpreted as factors
(including character strings), or a list (or data frame) whose
components can be so interpreted.  (For \code{as.table} and
\code{as.data.frame}, arguments passed to specific methods.)
\item[\code{exclude}] levels to remove for all factors in \code{...}.
If set to \code{NULL}, it implies \code{useNA = "always"}.  See
`Details' for its interpretation for non-factor arguments.
\item[\code{useNA}] whether to include \code{NA} values in the table.
See `Details'.
\item[\code{dnn}] the names to be given to the dimensions in the result (the
\emph{dimnames names}).
\item[\code{deparse.level}] controls how the default \code{dnn} is
constructed.  See `Details'.
\item[\code{x}] an arbitrary \R{} object, or an object inheriting from class
\code{"table"} for the \code{as.data.frame} method.
\item[\code{row.names}] a character vector giving the row names for the data
frame.
\item[\code{responseName}] The name to be used for the column of table
entries, usually counts.
\item[\code{stringsAsFactors}] logical: should the classifying factors be
returned as factors (the default) or character vectors?
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
If the argument \code{dnn} is not supplied, the internal function
\code{list.names} is called to compute the `dimname names'.  If the
arguments in \code{...} are named, those names are used.  For the
remaining arguments, \code{deparse.level = 0} gives an empty name,
\code{deparse.level = 1} uses the supplied argument if it is a symbol,
and \code{deparse.level = 2} will deparse the argument.

Only when \code{exclude} is specified and non-NULL (i.e., not by
default), will \code{table} potentially drop levels of factor
arguments.

\code{useNA} controls if the table includes counts of \code{NA}
values: the allowed values correspond to never, only if the count is
positive and even for zero counts.  This is overridden by specifying
\code{exclude = NULL}.  Note that levels specified in \code{exclude}
are mapped to \code{NA} and so included in \code{NA} counts.

Both \code{exclude} and \code{useNA} operate on an "all or none"
basis.  If you want to control the dimensions of a multiway table
separately, modify each argument using \code{\LinkA{factor}{factor}} or
\code{\LinkA{addNA}{addNA}}.

It is best to supply factors rather than rely on coercion.  In
particular, \code{exclude} will be used in coercion to a factor, and
so values (not levels) which appear in \code{exclude} before coercion
will be mapped to \code{NA} rather than be discarded.

The \code{summary} method for class \code{"table"} (used for objects
created by \code{table} or \code{\LinkA{xtabs}{xtabs}}) which gives basic
information and performs a chi-squared test for independence of
factors (note that the function \code{\LinkA{chisq.test}{chisq.test}} currently
only handles 2-d tables).
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{table()} returns a \emph{contingency table}, an object of
class \code{"table"}, an array of integer values.
Note that unlike S the result is always an array, a 1D array if one
factor is given.

\code{as.table} and \code{is.table} coerce to and test for contingency
table, respectively.

The \code{as.data.frame} method for objects inheriting from class
\code{"table"} can be used to convert the array-based representation
of a contingency table to a data frame containing the classifying
factors and the corresponding entries (the latter as component
named by \code{responseName}).  This is the inverse of \code{\LinkA{xtabs}{xtabs}}.

tapply(X, INDEX, FUN = NULL, ..., simplify = TRUE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{X}] an atomic object, typically a vector.
\item[\code{INDEX}] list of one of more factors, each of same length as
\code{X}.  The elements are coerced to factors by \code{\LinkA{as.factor}{as.factor}}.
\item[\code{FUN}] the function to be applied, or \code{NULL}.  In the case of
functions like \code{+}, \code{\%*\%}, etc., the function name must
be backquoted or quoted.  If \code{FUN} is \code{NULL}, tapply
returns a vector which can be used to subscript the multi-way array
\code{tapply} normally produces.
\item[\code{...}] optional arguments to \code{FUN}: the Note section.
\item[\code{simplify}] If \code{FALSE}, \code{tapply} always returns an array
of mode \code{"list"}.  If \code{TRUE} (the default), then if
\code{FUN} always returns a scalar, \code{tapply} returns an array
with the mode of the scalar.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Value}
If \code{FUN} is not \code{NULL}, it is passed to
\code{\LinkA{match.fun}{match.fun}}, and hence it can be a function or a symbol or
character string naming a function.

When \code{FUN} is present, \code{tapply} calls \code{FUN} for each
cell that has any data in it.  If \code{FUN} returns a single atomic
value for each such cell (e.g., functions \code{mean} or \code{var})
and when \code{simplify} is \code{TRUE}, \code{tapply} returns a
multi-way \LinkA{array}{array} containing the values, and \code{NA} for the
empty cells.  The array has the same number of dimensions as
\code{INDEX} has components; the number of levels in a dimension is
the number of levels (\code{nlevels()}) in the corresponding component
of \code{INDEX}.  Note that if the return value has a class (e.g. an
object of class \code{"\LinkA{Date}{Date}"}) the class is discarded.

Note that contrary to S, \code{simplify = TRUE} always returns an
array, possibly 1-dimensional.

If \code{FUN} does not return a single atomic value, \code{tapply}
returns an array of mode \code{\LinkA{list}{list}} whose components are the
values of the individual calls to \code{FUN}, i.e., the result is a
list with a \code{\LinkA{dim}{dim}} attribute.

When there is an array answer, its \code{\LinkA{dimnames}{dimnames}} are named by
the names of \code{INDEX} and are based on the levels of the grouping
factors (possibly after coercion).

For a list result, the elements corresponding to empty cells are
\code{NULL}.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
Optional arguments to \code{FUN} supplied by the \code{...} argument
are not divided into cells.  It is therefore inappropriate for
\code{FUN} to expect additional arguments with the same length as
\code{X}.

\item[\code{f}] the function that is to be invoked each time a top-level task
is successfully completed.  This is called with 5 or 4 arguments
depending on whether \code{data} is specified or not, respectively.
The return value should be a logical value indicating whether to
keep the callback in the list of active callbacks or discard it.
\item[\code{data}] if specified, this is the 5-th argument in the call to the
callback function \code{f}.
\item[\code{id}] a string or an integer identifying the element in the
internal callback list to be removed.
Integer indices are 1-based, i.e the first element is 1.
The names of currently registered handlers is available
using \code{\LinkA{getTaskCallbackNames}{getTaskCallbackNames}}
and is also returned in a call to \code{\LinkA{addTaskCallback}{addTaskCallback}}.

\item[\code{name}] character: names to be used.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
Top-level tasks are individual expressions
rather than entire lines of input.  Thus an input
line of the form \code{expression1 ; expression2}
will give rise to 2 top-level tasks.

A top-level task callback is called with the expression for the
top-level task, the result of the top-level task, a logical value
indicating whether it was successfully completed or not (always TRUE
at present), and a logical value indicating whether the result was
printed or not.  If the \code{data} argument was specified in the call
to \code{addTaskCallback}, that value is given as the fifth argument.

The callback function should return a logical value.
If the value is FALSE, the callback is removed from the task
list and will not be called again by this mechanism.
If the function returns TRUE, it is kept in the list and
will be called on the completion of the next top-level task.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{addTaskCallback} returns
an integer value giving  the position in the list
of task callbacks that this new callback occupies.
This is only the current position of the callback.
It can be used to remove the entry as long as
no other values are removed from earlier positions
in the list first.

\code{removeTaskCallback} returns a logical value
indicating whether the specified element was removed.
This can fail (i.e., return \code{FALSE})
if an incorrect name or index is given that does not
correspond to the name or position of an element in the list.

\HeaderA{taskCallbackManager}{Create an R-level Task Callback Manager}{taskCallbackManager}
\keyword{environment}{taskCallbackManager}
%
\begin{Description}\relax
This provides an entirely S-language mechanism
for managing callbacks or actions  that are invoked at
the conclusion of each top-level task.  Essentially,
we register a single R function from this manager
with the underlying, native
task-callback mechanism and this function handles invoking the other
R callbacks under the control of the manager.
The manager consists of a collection of functions that access shared
variables to manage the list of user-level callbacks.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
taskCallbackManager(handlers = list(), registered = FALSE,
                    verbose = FALSE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{handlers}] this can be a list of callbacks in which each element
is a list with  an element  named \code{"f"}
which is a callback function, and an optional
element named \code{"data"} which is the 5-th argument to be
supplied  to the callback when it is invoked.
Typically this argument is not specified, and one uses \code{add} to
register callbacks after the manager is created.
\item[\code{registered}] a logical value indicating whether
the \code{evaluate} function has already been registered
with the internal task callback mechanism.
This is usually \code{FALSE} and 
the first time a callback is added
via the \code{add} function, the
\code{evaluate} function is automatically registered.
One can control when the function is registered
by specifying \code{TRUE} for this argument
and calling \code{\LinkA{addTaskCallback}{addTaskCallback}} manually.

\item[\code{verbose}] a logical value, which if \code{TRUE},
causes information to be printed to the console
about certain activities this dispatch manager performs.
This is useful for debugging callbacks and the handler
itself.

\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Value}
A list containing 6 functions:
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{add}] register a callback with this manager, giving the
function, an optional 5-th argument, an optional name
by which the callback is stored in the list,
and a \code{register} argument which controls whether
the \code{evaluate} function is registered with the internal
C-level dispatch mechanism if necessary.
\item[\code{remove}] remove an element from the manager's collection
of callbacks, either by name or position/index.
\item[\code{evaluate}] the `real' callback function that is registered
with the C-level dispatch mechanism and which invokes each of the
R-level callbacks within this manager's control.
\item[\code{suspend}] a function to set the suspend state
of the manager.  If it is suspended, none of the callbacks will be
invoked when a task is completed.  One sets the state by specifying
a logical value for the \code{status} argument.

\item[\code{register}] a function to register the \code{evaluate}
function with the internal C-level dispatch mechanism.  This is
done automatically by the \code{add} function, but can be called
manually.
\item[\code{callbacks}] returns the list of callbacks being maintained by this
manager.

%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
tempfile(pattern = "file", tmpdir = tempdir(), fileext = "")
tempdir()
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{pattern}] a non-empty character vector giving the initial part
of the name.
\item[\code{tmpdir}] a non-empty character vector giving the directory name
\item[\code{fileext}] a non-empty character vector giving the file extension
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The length of the result is the maximum of the lengths of the three
arguments; values of shorter arguments are recycled.

The names are very likely to be unique among calls to \code{tempfile}
in an \R{} session and across simultaneous \R{} sessions (unless
\code{tmpdir} is specified).  The filenames are guaranteed not to be
currently in use.

The file name is made by concatenating the path given by
\code{tmpdir}, the \code{pattern} string, a random string in hex and
a suffix of \code{fileext}.

By default, \code{tmpdir} will be the directory given by
\code{tempdir()}.  This will be a subdirectory of the per-session
temporary directory found by the following rule when the \R{} session is
started.  The environment variables \env{TMPDIR}, \env{TMP} and
\env{TEMP} are checked in turn and the first found which points to a
writable directory is used:
if none succeeds the value of \env{R\_USER} (see
\code{\LinkA{Rconsole}{Rconsole}}) is used.  If the path to the directory
contains a space in any of the components, the path returned will use
the shortnames version of the path.
Note that setting any of these environment variables in the \R{} session
has no effect on \code{tempdir()}: the per-session temporary directory
is created before the interpreter is started.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
For \code{tempfile} a character vector giving the names of possible
(temporary) files.  Note that no files are generated by \code{tempfile}.

For \code{tempdir}, the path of the per-session temporary directory.

Both will use backslash as the path separator.
\end{Value}

\begin{Section}{Note on parallel}
\R{} processes forked by functions such as \code{\LinkA{mclapply}{mclapply}} in
package \pkg{parallel} (or \Rhref{http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=multicore}{\pkg{multicore}}) share a per-session
temporary directory.  Further, the `guaranteed not to be
currently in use' applies only at the time of asking, and two
children could ask simultaneously.  As from \R{} 2.14.1 this is avoided
by ensuring that \code{tempfile} calls in different children try
different names.

\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{object}] character.  A description of the \LinkA{connection}{connection}. 
For an input this is an \R{} character vector object, and for an output
connection the name for the \R{} character vector to receive the
output, or \code{NULL} (for none).

\item[\code{open}] character.  Either \code{"r"} (or equivalently \code{""})
for an input connection or \code{"w"} or \code{"a"} for an output
connection.
\item[\code{local}] logical.  Used only for output connections.  If \code{TRUE},
output is assigned to a variable in the calling environment.  Otherwise
the global environment is used.
\item[\code{encoding}] character.  Used only for input connections.  How
marked strings in \code{object} should be handled: converted to the
current locale, used byte-by-byte or translated to UTF-8.
\item[\code{con}] An output text connection.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
An input text connection is opened and the character vector is copied
at time the connection object is created, and \code{close} destroys
the copy.  \code{object} should be the name of a character vector:
however, short expressions will be accepted provided they \LinkA{deparse}{deparse} to
less than 60 bytes.

An output text connection is opened and creates an \R{} character vector
of the given name in the user's workspace or in the calling environment,
depending on the value of the \code{local} argument.  This object will at all
times hold the completed lines of output to the connection, and
\code{\LinkA{isIncomplete}{isIncomplete}} will indicate if there is an incomplete
final line.  Closing the connection will output the final line,
complete or not.  (A line is complete once it has been terminated by
end-of-line, represented by \code{"\bsl{}n"} in \R{}.)   The output character
vector has locked bindings (see \code{\LinkA{lockBinding}{lockBinding}}) until
\code{close} is called on the connection.  The character vector can
also be retrieved \emph{via} \code{textConnectionValue}, which is the
only way to do so if \code{object = NULL}.  If the current locale is
detected as Latin-1 or UTF-8, non-ASCII elements of the character vector
will be marked accordingly (see \code{Encoding}).

Opening a text connection with \code{mode = "a"} will attempt to
append to an existing character vector with the given name in the
user's workspace or the calling environment.  If none is found (even
if an object exists of the right name but the wrong type) a new
character vector will be created, with a warning.

You cannot \code{seek} on a text connection, and \code{seek} will
always return zero as the position.

Text connections have slightly unusual semantics: they are always
open, and throwing away an input text connection without closing it
(so it get garbage-collected) does not give a warning.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
For \code{textConnection}, a connection object of class
\code{"textConnection"} which inherits from class \code{"connection"}.

For \code{textConnectionValue}, a character vector.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
As output text connections keep the character vector up to date
line-by-line, they are relatively expensive to use, and it is often
better to use an anonymous \code{\LinkA{file}{file}()} connection to collect
output.

On (rare) platforms where \code{vsnprintf} does not return the needed
length of output there is a 100,000 character limit on the length of
line for output connections: longer lines will be truncated with a
warning.

Sys.timezone()
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
Time zones are a system-specific topic, but these days almost all \R{}
platforms use the same underlying code, used by Linux, Mac OS X,
Solaris, AIX, FreeBSD, Sun Java >= 1.4 and Tcl >= 8.5, and installed
with \R{} on Windows.

It is not in general possible to retrieve the system's own name(s) for
the current timezone, but \code{Sys.timezone} will retrieve the name
it uses for the current time (and the name may differ depending on
whether daylight saving time is in effect).

On most platforms it is  possible to set the time zone via the
environment variable \env{TZ}: see the section on `Time zone
names' for suitable values.

Note that the principal difficulty with time zones is their individual
history: over the last 100 years places have changed their affiliation
between major time zones, have opted out of (or in to) DST in
various years or adopted rule changes late or not at all.  This often
involves tiny administrative units in the US/Canada: Iowa had 23
different implementations of DST in the 1960's!

Time zones did not come into use until the second half of the
nineteenth century, and DST was first introduced in the early
twentieth century, most widely during the First World War (in 1916).
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{Sys.timezone} returns an OS-specific character string, possibly
an empty string.  Typically this is an abbreviation such as \code{"EST"}. 
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{Time zone names}
Where OSes describe their valid time zones can be obscure.  The help
for the C function \code{tzset} can be helpful, but it
can also be inaccurate.  There is a cumbersome POSIX specification
(listed under environment variable \env{TZ} at
\url{http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap08.html#tag_08}),
which is often at least partially supported, but there usually are
other more user-friendly ways to specify timezones.

Many systems make use of a timezone database compiled by Arthur Olson,
in which the preferred way to refer to a time zone by a location
(typically of a city) e.g. \code{Europe/London},
\code{America/Los\_Angeles}, \code{Pacific/Easter}.  Some traditional
designations are also allowed such as \code{EST5EDT} or
\code{GB}.  (Beware that some of these designations may not be what you
think: in particular \code{EST} is a time zone used in Canada
\emph{without} daylight savings time, and not \code{EST5EDT} nor
(Australian) Eastern Standard Time.)  The designation can also be an
optional colon prepended to the path to a file giving complied zone
information (and the examples above are all files in a system-specific
location).  See \url{http://www.twinsun.com/tz/tz-link.htm} for more
details and references.  By convention, regions with a unique timezone
history since 1970 have specific names, but those with different
earlier histories may not.

\R{} under Windows uses the Olson database.  The current version of the
database will be given in file
\file{\var{\LinkA{R\_HOME}{R.Rul.HOME}}\bsl{}share\bsl{}zoneinfo\bsl{}VERSION}.
Environment variable \env{TZDIR} can be used to point to a later
\file{zoneinfo} directory.  A file listing most known time zones can be
found at \file{\var{\LinkA{R\_HOME}{R.Rul.HOME}}\bsl{}share\bsl{}zoneinfo\bsl{}zone.tab} (see
`Examples').   By convention, regions with a unique timezone
history since 1970 have specific names, but those with different
earlier histories may not.

An attempt is made (once only per session) to map Windows' idea of
the current time zone to a location, following an earlier version of
\url{http://unicode.org/repos/cldr/trunk/common/supplemental/windowsZones.xml}
If this is not successful, it can be overridden by setting the
\env{TZ} environment variable.

Windows documents a specification of the form \code{GST-1GDT}: this is
interpreted as POSIX-like and hence the `US rules' for changing
to/from DST are applied (and are incorrect for Germany).  Versions of
\R{} prior to 2.7.0 used Windows' system functions and hence this form:
it is still accepted for backwards compatibility but was (and remains)
unreliable and gives a warning.

Many systems support timezones of the form \samp{GMT+n} and
\samp{GMT-n}, which are at a fixed offset from UTC (hence no DST).
Contrary to some usage (but consistent with names such as
\samp{PST8PDT}), negative offsets are times ahead of (east of) UTC,
positive offsets are times behind (west of) UTC.
\end{Section}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
There is currently (since 2007) considerable disruption over changes
to the timings of the DST transitions, aimed at energy conservation.
These often have short notice and timezone databases may not be up to
date (even if the OS has been updated recently).

Note that except on Windows, the operation of time zones is an OS
service, and even on Windows a third-party database is used and can be
updated (see the section on `Time zone names').  Incorrect
results will never be an \R{} issue, so please ensure that you have the
courtesy not to blame \R{} for them.

%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{what}] The name (quoted or not) of a function to be traced or
untraced.  For \code{untrace} or for \code{trace} with more than one
argument, more than one name can be given in the quoted form, and
the same action will be applied to each one.
\item[\code{tracer}] Either a function or an unevaluated expression.  The
function will be called or the expression will be evaluated either
at the beginning of the call, or before those steps in the call
specified by the argument \code{at}.
See the details section.
\item[\code{exit}]  Either a function or an unevaluated expression.  The
function will be called or the expression will be evaluated on
exiting the function.
See the details section.
\item[\code{at}] optional numeric vector or list.  If supplied, \code{tracer}
will be called just before the corresponding step in the body of the
function.
See the details section. 
\item[\code{print}] If \code{TRUE} (as per default), a descriptive line is
printed before any trace expression is evaluated.
\item[\code{signature}]  If this argument is supplied, it should be a
signature for a method for function \code{what}.  In this case, the
method, and \emph{not} the function itself, is traced.
\item[\code{edit}]  For complicated tracing, such as tracing within a loop
inside the function, you will need to insert the desired calls by
editing the body of the function.  If so, supply the \code{edit}
argument either as \code{TRUE}, or as the name of the editor you
want to use.  Then \code{trace()} will call \code{\LinkA{edit}{edit}} and
use the version of the function after you edit it.  See the details
section for additional information.

\item[\code{where}] where to look for the function to be
traced; by default, the top-level environment of the call to
\code{trace}.

An important use of this argument is to trace a function when it
is called from a package with a namespace.  The current namespace mechanism
imports the functions to be called (with the exception of functions
in the base package).  The functions being called are \emph{not} the
same objects seen from the top-level (in general, the imported
packages may not even be attached).  Therefore, you must ensure that
the correct versions are being traced.  The way to do this is to set
argument \code{where} to a function in the namespace.  The tracing
computations will then start looking in the environment of that
function (which will be the namespace of the corresponding package).
(Yes, it's subtle, but the semantics here are central to how
namespaces work in R.)

\item[\code{on}] logical; a call to  the support function \code{tracingState} returns \code{TRUE}
if tracing is globally turned on, \code{FALSE} otherwise.  An
argument of one or the other of those values sets the state.  If the
tracing state is \code{FALSE}, none of the trace actions will
actually occur (used, for example, by debugging functions to shut
off tracing during debugging).
\item[\code{expr, msg}] arguments to the support function \code{.doTrace}, calls to
which are inserted into the modified function or method:
\code{expr} is the tracing action (such as a call to
\code{browser()}, and \code{msg} is a string identifying the
place where the trace action occurs.

\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The \code{trace} function operates by constructing a revised version
of the function (or of the method, if \code{signature} is supplied),
and assigning the new object back where the original was found.
If only the \code{what} argument is given, a line of trace printing is
produced for each call to the function (back compatible with the
earlier version of \code{trace}).

The object constructed by \code{trace} is from a class that extends
\code{"function"} and which contains the original, untraced version.
A call to \code{untrace} re-assigns this version.

If the argument \code{tracer} or \code{exit} is the name of a
function, the tracing expression will be a call to that function, with
no arguments.  This is the easiest and most common case, with the
functions \code{\LinkA{browser}{browser}} and \code{\LinkA{recover}{recover}} the
likeliest candidates; the former browses in the frame of the function
being traced, and the latter allows browsing in any of the currently
active calls.

The \code{tracer} or \code{exit} argument can also be an unevaluated
expression (such as returned by a call to \code{\LinkA{quote}{quote}} or
\code{\LinkA{substitute}{substitute}}).  This expression itself is inserted in the
traced function, so it will typically involve arguments or local
objects in the traced function.  An expression of this form is useful
if you only want to interact when certain conditions apply (and in
this case you probably want to supply \code{print=FALSE} in the call
to \code{trace} also).

When the \code{at} argument is supplied, it can be a vector of
integers referring to the substeps of the body of the function (this
only works if the body of the function is enclosed in \code{\{ ...\}}.  In
this case \code{tracer} is \emph{not} called on entry, but instead
just before evaluating each of the steps listed in \code{at}.  (Hint:
you don't want to try to count the steps in the printed version of a
function; instead, look at \code{as.list(body(f))} to get the numbers
associated with the steps in function \code{f}.)

The \code{at} argument can also be a list of integer vectors.  In
this case, each vector refers to a step nested within another step of
the function.  For example, \code{at = list(c(3,4))}
will call the tracer just before the fourth step of the third step
of the function.  See the example below.

Using \code{\LinkA{setBreakpoint}{setBreakpoint}} (from package \pkg{utils}) may be an
alternative, calling \code{trace(...., at, ...)}.

An intrinsic limitation in the \code{exit} argument is that it won't
work if the function itself uses \code{on.exit}, since the existing
calls will override the one supplied by \code{trace}.

Tracing does not nest.  Any call to \code{trace} replaces previously
traced versions of that function or method (except for edited
versions as discussed below), and \code{untrace} always
restores an untraced version.  (Allowing nested tracing has too many
potentials for confusion and for accidentally leaving traced versions
behind.)

When the \code{edit} argument is used repeatedly with no call to
\code{untrace} on the same function or method in between, the
previously edited version is retained.  If you want to throw away
all the previous tracing and then edit, call \code{untrace} before the next
call to \code{trace}.  Editing may be combined with automatic
tracing; just supply the other arguments such as \code{tracer}, and
the \code{edit} argument as well.  The \code{edit=TRUE} argument
uses the default editor (see \code{\LinkA{edit}{edit}}).

Tracing primitive functions (builtins and specials) from the base
package works, but only by a special mechanism and not very
informatively.  Tracing a primitive causes the primitive to be
replaced by a function with argument \dots (only).  You can get a bit
of information out, but not much.  A warning message is issued when
\code{trace} is used on a primitive.

The practice of saving the traced version of the function back where
the function came from means that tracing carries over from one
session to another, \emph{if} the traced function is saved in the
session image.  (In the next session, \code{untrace} will remove the
tracing.)  On the other hand, functions that were in a package, not in
the global environment, are not saved in the image, so tracing expires
with the session for such functions.

Tracing a method is basically just like tracing a function, with the
exception that the traced version is stored by a call to
\code{\LinkA{setMethod}{setMethod}} rather than by direct assignment, and so is
the untraced version after a call to \code{untrace}.

The version of \code{trace} described here is largely compatible with
the version in S-Plus, although the two work by entirely different
mechanisms.  The S-Plus \code{trace} uses the session frame, with the
result that tracing never carries over from one session to another (\R{}
does not have a session frame).  Another relevant distinction has
nothing directly to do with \code{trace}:  The browser in S-Plus
allows changes to be made to the frame being browsed, and the changes
will persist after exiting the browser.  The \R{} browser allows changes,
but they disappear when the browser exits.  This may be relevant in
that the S-Plus version allows you to experiment with code changes
interactively, but the \R{} version does not.  (A future revision may
include a `destructive' browser for \R{}.)
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
In the simple version (just the first argument), invisible \code{NULL}.
Otherwise, the traced function(s) name(s).  The relevant consequence is the
assignment that takes place.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
The version of function tracing that includes any of the arguments
except for the function name requires the \pkg{methods} package
(because it uses special classes of objects to store and restore
versions of the traced functions).

If methods dispatch is not currently on, \code{trace} will load the
methods namespace, but will not put the methods package on the search
list.

\begin{Description}\relax
By default \code{traceback()} prints the call stack of the last
uncaught error, i.e., the sequence of calls that lead to the error.
This is useful when an error occurs with an unidentifiable error
message.  It can also be used to print the current stack or
arbitrary lists of deparsed calls.  
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
traceback(x = NULL, max.lines = getOption("deparse.max.lines"))
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] \code{NULL} (default, meaning \code{.Traceback}), or an
integer count of calls to skip in the current stack, or a list or
pairlist of deparsed calls.  See the details.   
\item[\code{max.lines}] The maximum number of lines to be printed
\emph{per call}.  The default is unlimited.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The default display is of the stack of the last uncaught error as
stored as a list of deparsed calls in \code{.Traceback}, which
\code{traceback} prints in a user-friendly format.  The stack of
deparsed calls always contains all function calls and all foreign
function calls (such as \code{\LinkA{.Call}{.Call}}): if profiling is in
progress it will include calls to some primitive functions.  (Calls
to builtins are included, but not to specials.)

Errors which are caught \emph{via} \code{\LinkA{try}{try}} or
\code{\LinkA{tryCatch}{tryCatch}} do not generate a traceback, so what is printed
is the call sequence for the last uncaught error, and not necessarily
for the last error.

If \code{x} is numeric, then the current stack is printed, skipping
\code{x} entries at the top of the stack.  For example,
\code{options(error=function() traceback(2))} will print the stack
at the time of the error, skipping the call to \code{traceback()}
and the error function that called it.

Otherwise, \code{x} is assumed to be a list or pairlist of deparsed
calls and will be displayed in the same way.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{traceback()} prints the deparsed call stack deepest call
first, and returns it invisibly.  The calls may print on more than
one line, and the first line for each call is labelled by the frame
number.  The number of lines printed per call can be limited via
\code{max.lines}.

\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
This functionality is optional, determined at compilation, because it
makes R run a little more slowly even when no objects are being
traced.  \code{tracemem} and \code{untracemem} give errors when R is not
compiled with memory profiling; \code{retracemem} does not (so it can be
left in code during development).

It is enabled in the standard Mac OS X and Windows builds of \R{}.

When an object is traced any copying of the object by the C function
\code{duplicate} produces a message to standard output, as does type
coercion and copying when passing arguments to \code{.C} or
\code{.Fortran}.

The message consists of the string \code{tracemem}, the identifying
strings for the object being copied and the new object being created,
and a stack trace showing where the duplication occurred.
\code{retracemem()} is used to indicate that a variable should be
considered a copy of a previous variable (e.g. after subscripting).

The messages can be turned off with \code{\LinkA{tracingState}{tracingState}}.

It is not possible to trace functions, as this would conflict with
\code{\LinkA{trace}{trace}} and it is not useful to trace \code{NULL},
environments, promises, weak references, or external pointer objects, as
these are not duplicated.

These functions are \LinkA{primitive}{primitive}.

\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] a vector or a data frame or an array or \code{NULL}.
\item[\code{incomparables}] a vector of values that cannot be compared.
\code{FALSE} is a special value, meaning that all values can be
compared, and may be the only value accepted for methods other than
the default.  It will be coerced internally to the same type as
\code{x}.
\item[\code{fromLast}] logical indicating if duplication should be considered
from the last, i.e., the last (or rightmost) of identical elements will
be kept.  This only matters for \code{\LinkA{names}{names}} or
\code{\LinkA{dimnames}{dimnames}}.
\item[\code{...}] arguments for particular methods.
\item[\code{MARGIN}] the array margin to be held fixed: a single integer.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
This is a generic function with methods for vectors, data frames and
arrays (including matrices).

The array method calculates for each element of the dimension
specified by \code{MARGIN} if the remaining dimensions are identical
to those for an earlier element (in row-major order).  This would most
commonly be used for matrices to find unique rows (the default) or columns
(with \code{MARGIN = 2}).

Note that unlike the Unix command \code{uniq} this omits
\emph{duplicated} and not just \emph{repeated} elements/rows.  That
is, an element is omitted if it is equal to any previous element and
not just if it is equal the immediately previous one.  (For the
latter, see \code{\LinkA{rle}{rle}}).

Missing values are regarded as equal, but \code{NaN} is not equal to
\code{NA\_real\_}.  Character strings are regarded as equal if they are
in different encodings but would agree when translated to UTF-8.

Values in \code{incomparables} will never be marked as duplicated.
This is intended to be used for a fairly small set of values and will
not be efficient for a very large set.

When used on a data frame with more than one column, or an array or
matrix when comparing dimensions of length greater than one, this
tests for identity of character representations.  This will
catch people who unwisely rely on exact equality of floating-point
numbers!

Character strings will be compared as byte sequences if any input is
marked as \code{"bytes"}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
For a vector, an object of the same type of \code{x}, but with only
one copy of each duplicated element.  No attributes are copied (so
the result has no names).

For a data frame, a data frame is returned with the same columns but
possibly fewer rows (and with row names from the first occurrences of
the unique rows).

A matrix or array is subsetted by \code{[, drop = FALSE]}, so
dimensions and dimnames are copied appropriately, and the result
always has the same number of dimensions as \code{x}.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{Warning}
Using this for lists is potentially slow, especially if the elements
are not atomic vectors (see \code{\LinkA{vector}{vector}}) or differ only
in their attributes.  In the worst case it is \eqn{O(n^2)}{}.

\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] an \R{} object, typically a list or vector.
\item[\code{recursive}] logical.  Should unlisting be applied to list
components of \code{x}?
\item[\code{use.names}] logical.  Should names be preserved?
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{unlist} is generic: you can write methods to handle
specific classes of objects, see \LinkA{InternalMethods}{InternalMethods},
and note, e.g., \code{\LinkA{relist}{relist}} with the \code{unlist} method
for \code{relistable} objects.

If \code{recursive = FALSE}, the function will not recurse beyond the
first level items in \code{x}.

Factors are treated specially.  If all non-list elements of \code{x}
are factors (or ordered factors) then the result will be a factor with
levels the union of the level sets of the elements, in the order the
levels occur in the level sets of the elements (which means that if
all the elements have the same level set, that is the level set of the
result).

\code{x} can be an atomic vector, but then \code{unlist} does nothing useful,
not even drop names.

By default, \code{unlist} tries to retain the naming
information present in \code{x}.  If \code{use.names = FALSE} all
naming information is dropped.

Where possible the list elements are coerced to a common mode during
the unlisting, and so the result often ends up as a character
vector.  Vectors will be coerced to the highest type of the components
in the hierarchy NULL < raw < logical < integer < real < complex < character
< list < expression: pairlists are treated as lists.

A list is a (generic) vector, and the simplified vector might still be
a list (and might be unchanged).  Non-vector elements of the list
(for example language elements such as names, formulas and calls)
are not coerced, and so a list containing one or more of these remains a
list.  (The effect of unlisting an \code{\LinkA{lm}{lm}} fit is a list which
has individual residuals as components.)
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
\code{NULL} or an expression or a vector of an appropriate mode to
hold the list components.

The output type is determined from the highest type

complex < character < list < expression, after coercion of pairlists
to lists.

\R{} possesses a simple generic function mechanism which can be used for
an object-oriented style of programming.  Method dispatch takes place
based on the class(es) of the first argument to the generic function or of
the object supplied as an argument to \code{UseMethod} or \code{NextMethod}.
\end{Description}

\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{generic}] a character string naming a function (and not a
built-in operator).  Required for \code{UseMethod}.
\item[\code{object}] for \code{UseMethod}: an object whose class will
determine the method to be dispatched.  Defaults to the first
argument of the enclosing function.
\item[\code{...}] further arguments to be passed to the next method.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
An \R{} object is a data object which has a \code{class}
attribute (and this can be tested by \code{\LinkA{is.object}{is.object}}).
A class attribute is a character vector giving the names of
the classes from which the object \emph{inherits}.
If the object does not have a class attribute, it has an implicit
class.  Matrices and arrays have class \code{"matrix"}
or\code{"array"} followed by the class of the underlying vector.
Most vectors have class the result of \code{\LinkA{mode}{mode}(x)}, except
that integer vectors have class \code{c("integer", "numeric")} and
real vectors have class \code{c("double", "numeric")}.

When a function calling \code{UseMethod("fun")} is applied to an
object with class attribute \code{c("first", "second")}, the system
searches for a function called \code{fun.first} and, if it finds it,
applies it to the object.  If no such function is found a function
called \code{fun.second} is tried.  If no class name produces a
suitable function, the function \code{fun.default} is used, if it
exists, or an error results.

Function \code{\LinkA{methods}{methods}} can be used to find out about the
methods for a particular generic function or class.

\code{UseMethod} is a primitive function but (as from \R{} 2.11.0) uses
standard argument matching.  It is not the only means of dispatch of
methods, for there are \LinkA{internal generic}{internal generic} and \LinkA{group generic}{group generic}
functions.  \code{UseMethod} currently dispatches on the implicit
class even for arguments that are not objects, but the other means of
dispatch do not.

\code{NextMethod} invokes the next method (determined by the
class vector, either of the object supplied to the generic, or of
the first argument to the function containing \code{NextMethod} if a
method was invoked directly).  Normally \code{NextMethod} is used with
only one argument, \code{generic}, but if further arguments are
supplied these modify the call to the next method.

\code{NextMethod} should not be called except in methods called by
\code{UseMethod} or from internal generics (see
\LinkA{InternalGenerics}{InternalGenerics}).  In particular it will not work inside
anonymous calling functions (e.g. \code{get("print.ts")(AirPassengers)}).

Namespaces can register methods for generic functions.  To support
this, \code{UseMethod} and \code{NextMethod} search for methods in
two places: first in the environment in which the generic function
is called, and then in the registration data base for the
environment in which the generic is defined (typically a namespace).
So methods for a generic function need to be available in the
environment of the call to the generic, or they must be registered.
(It does not matter whether they are visible in the environment in
which the generic is defined.)
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Section}{Technical Details}
Now for some obscure details that need to appear somewhere.  These
comments will be slightly different than those in Chambers(1992).
(See also the draft `R Language Definition'.)
\code{UseMethod} creates a new function call with
arguments matched as they came in to the generic.  Any local variables
defined before the call to \code{UseMethod} are retained (unlike S).  Any
statements after the call to \code{UseMethod} will not be evaluated as
\code{UseMethod} does not return.  \code{UseMethod} can be called with
more than two arguments: a warning will be given and additional
arguments ignored.  (They are not completely ignored in S.)  If it is
called with just one argument, the class of the first argument of the
enclosing function is used as \code{object}: unlike S this is the first
actual argument passed and not the current value of the object of that
name.

\code{NextMethod} works by creating a special call frame for the next
method.  If no new arguments are supplied, the arguments will be the
same in number, order and name as those to the current method but
their values will be promises to evaluate their name in the current
method and environment.  Any named arguments matched to \code{...}
are handled specially: they either replace existing arguments of the
same name or are appended to the argument list.  They are passed on as
the promise that was supplied as an argument to the current
environment.  (S does this differently!)  If they have been evaluated
in the current (or a previous environment) they remain evaluated.
(This is a complex area, and subject to change: see the draft
`R Language Definition'.)

The search for methods for \code{NextMethod} is slightly different
from that for \code{UseMethod}.   Finding no \code{fun.default} is not
necessarily an error, as the search continues to the generic
itself.  This is to pick up an \LinkA{internal generic}{internal generic} like \code{[}
which has no separate default method, and succeeds only if the generic
is a \LinkA{primitive}{primitive} function or a wrapper for a
\code{\LinkA{.Internal}{.Internal}} function of the same name.  (When a primitive
is called as the default method, argument matching may not work as
described above due to the different semantics of primitives.)

You will see objects such as \code{.Generic}, \code{.Method}, and
\code{.Class} used in methods.  These are set in the environment
within which the method is evaluated by the dispatch mechanism, which
is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}

\item Find the context for the calling function (the generic): this
gives us the unevaluated arguments for the original call.
\item Evaluate the object (usually an argument) to be used for
dispatch, and find a method (possibly the default method) or throw
an error.
\item Create an environment for evaluating the method and insert
special variables (see below) into that environment.  Also copy any
variables in the environment of the generic that are not formal (or
actual) arguments.
\item Fix up the argument list to be the arguments of the call
matched to the formals of the method.

\end{enumerate}

\code{.Generic} is a length-one character vector naming the generic function.

\code{.Method} is a character vector (normally of length one) naming
the method function.  (For functions in the group generic
\code{\LinkA{Ops}{S3groupGeneric}} it is of length two.)

\code{.Class} is a character vector of classes used to find the next
method.  \code{NextMethod} adds an attribute \code{"previous"} to
\code{.Class} giving the \code{.Class} last used for dispatch, and
shifts \code{.Class} along to that used for dispatch.

\code{.GenericCallEnv} and \code{.GenericDefEnv} are the environments
of the call to be generic and defining the generic respectively.  (The
latter is used to find methods registered for the generic.)

Note that \code{.Class} is set when the generic is called, and is
unchanged if the class of the dispatching argument is changed in a
method.  It is possible to change the method that \code{NextMethod}
would dispatch by manipulating \code{.Class}, but `this is not
recommended unless you understand the inheritance mechanism
thoroughly' (Chambers \& Hastie, 1992, p. 469).

\begin{Details}\relax
\code{setHook} provides a general mechanism for users to register
hooks, a list of functions to be called from system (or user)
functions.  The initial set of hooks was associated with events on
packages/namespaces: these hooks are named via calls to
\code{packageEvent}.

To remove a hook completely, call \code{setHook(hookName, NULL, "replace")}.

When an \R{} package is attached by \code{\LinkA{library}{library}} or loaded by
other means, it can call initialization code.  See
\code{\LinkA{.onLoad}{.onLoad}} for a description of the package hook functions
called during initialization.  Users can add their own initialization
code via the hooks provided by \code{setHook()}, functions which will
be called as \code{funname(pkgname, pkgpath)} inside a
\code{\LinkA{try}{try}} call.

The sequence of events depends on which hooks are defined, and whether
a package is attached or just loaded.  In the case where all hooks
are defined and a package is attached, the order of initialization 
events is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}

\item The package namespace is loaded.
\item The package's \code{\LinkA{.onLoad}{.onLoad}} function is run.
\item The namespace is sealed.
\item The user's \code{"onLoad"} hook is run.  
\item The package is added to the search path.
\item The package's \code{\LinkA{.onAttach}{.onAttach}} function is run.
\item The package environment is sealed.
\item The user's \code{"attach"} hook is run.

\end{enumerate}


A similar sequence (but in reverse) is run when a package is detached
and its namespace unloaded:
\begin{enumerate}

\item The user's \code{"detach"} hook is run.
\item The package's \code{\LinkA{.Last.lib}{.Last.lib}} function is run. 
\item The package is removed from the search path.  
\item The user's \code{"onUnload"} hook is run.  
\item The package's \code{\LinkA{.onUnload}{.onUnload}} function is run.
\item The package namespace is unloaded.

\end{enumerate}

Note that when an \R{} session is finished, packages are not detached and
namespaces are not unloaded, so the corresponding hooks will not be
run.  

Also note that some of the user hooks are run without the package
being on the search path, so in those hooks objects in the package
need to be referred to using the double (or triple) colon operator,
as in the example.

If multiple hooks are added, they are normally run in the order shown
by \code{getHook}, but the \code{"detach"} and \code{"onUnload"} hooks
are run in reverse order so the default for package events is to add
hooks `inside' existing ones.

The hooks are stored in the environment \code{.userHooksEnv} in the
base package, with `mangled' names.

\begin{Description}\relax
\code{vector} produces a vector of the given length and mode.

\code{as.vector}, a generic, attempts to coerce its argument into a
vector of mode \code{mode} (the default is to coerce to whichever
vector mode is most convenient): if the result is atomic all
attributes are removed.

\code{is.vector} returns \code{TRUE} if \code{x} is a vector of the
specified mode having no attributes \emph{other than names}.  It returns
\code{FALSE} otherwise.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
vector(mode = "logical", length = 0)
as.vector(x, mode = "any")
is.vector(x, mode = "any")
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{mode}] A character string giving an atomic mode or
\code{"list"}, or (except for \code{vector}) \code{"any"}.
\item[\code{length}] A non-negative integer specifying the desired length.
Double values will be coerced to integer:
supplying an argument of length other than one is an error.
\item[\code{x}] An object.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The atomic modes are \code{"logical"}, \code{"integer"},
\code{"numeric"} (synonym \code{"double"}), \code{"complex"},
\code{"character"} and \code{"raw"}.

If \code{mode = "any"}, \code{is.vector} may return \code{TRUE} for
the atomic modes, \code{\LinkA{list}{list}} and \code{\LinkA{expression}{expression}}.
For any \code{mode}, it will return \code{FALSE} if \code{x} has any
attributes except names.  (This is incompatible with S.)  On the other
hand, \code{as.vector} removes \emph{all} attributes including names
for results of atomic mode (but not those of mode \code{"list"} nor
\code{"expression"}).

Note that factors are \emph{not} vectors; \code{is.vector} returns
\code{FALSE} and \code{as.vector} converts a factor to a character
vector for \code{mode = "any"}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
For \code{vector}, a vector of the given length and mode.  Logical
vector elements are initialized to \code{FALSE}, numeric vector
elements to \code{0}, character vector elements to \code{""}, raw
vector elements to \code{nul} bytes and list elements to \code{NULL}.

For \code{as.vector}, a vector (atomic or of type list).  All
attributes are removed from the result if it is of an atomic mode, but
not in general for a list result.  The default method handles 24 input
types and 12 values of \code{type}: the details of most coercions are
undocumented and subject to change.

For \code{is.vector}, \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}.
\code{is.vector(x, mode = "numeric")} can be true for vectors of types
\code{"integer"} or \code{"double"} whereas \code{is.vector(x, mode =
  "double")} can only be true for those of type \code{"double"}.
\end{Value}
%
\begin{Section}{Methods for \code{as.vector()}}
Writers of methods for \code{as.vector} need to take care to
follow the conventions of the default method.  In particular
\begin{itemize}

\item Argument \code{mode} can be \code{"any"}, any of the atomic
modes, \code{"list"}, \code{"expression"}, \code{"symbol"},
\code{"pairlist"} or one of the aliases \code{"double"} and \code{"name"}.

\item The return value should be of the appropriate mode.  For
\code{mode = "any"} this means an atomic vector or list.

\item Attributes should be treated appropriately: in particular when
the result is an atomic vector there should be no attributes, not
even names.

\item \code{is.vector(as.vector(x, m), m)} should be true for any
mode \code{m}, including the default \code{"any"}.

\end{itemize}

\end{Section}
%
\begin{Note}\relax
\code{as.vector} and \code{is.vector} are quite distinct from the
meaning of the formal class \code{"vector"} in the \pkg{methods}
package, and hence \code{\LinkA{as}{as}(x, "vector")} and
\code{\LinkA{is}{is}(x, "vector")}.

Note that \code{as.vector(x)} is not necessarily a null operation if
\code{is.vector(x)} is true: any names will be removed from an atomic
vector.

\code{mode}s of \code{"symbol"} (synonym \code{"name"}),
\code{"pairlist"} and \code{"expression"} are allowed but have long
been undocumented: they are used to implement \code{\LinkA{as.name}{as.name}},
\code{\LinkA{as.pairlist}{as.pairlist}} and \code{\LinkA{as.expression}{as.expression}}, and those
functions should preferably be used directly.  None of the description
here applies to those \code{mode}s: see the help for the preferred
forms.

Generates a warning message that corresponds to its argument(s) and

warning(..., call. = TRUE, immediate. = FALSE, domain = NULL)
suppressWarnings(expr)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{...}] zero or more objects which can be coerced to character
(and which are pasted together with no separator) or a single
condition object.
\item[\code{call.}] logical, indicating if the call should become part of the
warning message.
\item[\code{immediate.}] logical, indicating if the call should be output
immediately, even if \code{\LinkA{getOption}{getOption}("warn") <= 0}.
\item[\code{expr}] expression to evaluate.
\item[\code{domain}] see \code{\LinkA{gettext}{gettext}}. If \code{NA}, messages will
not be translated.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
The result \emph{depends} on the value of
\code{\LinkA{options}{options}("warn")} and on handlers established in the
executing code.

If a condition object is supplied it should be the only argument, and
further arguments will be ignored, with a message.

\code{warning} signals a warning condition by (effectively) calling
\code{signalCondition}.  If there are no handlers or if all handlers
return, then the value of \code{warn = \LinkA{getOption}{getOption}("warn")} is
used to determine the appropriate action.  If \code{warn} is negative
warnings are ignored; if it is zero they are stored and printed after
the top--level function has completed; if it is one they are printed
as they occur and if it is 2 (or larger) warnings are turned into
errors. Calling \code{warning(immediate. = TRUE)} turns \code{warn <=
    0} into \code{warn = 1} for this call only.


If \code{warn} is zero (the default), a read-only variable
\code{last.warning} is created.  It contains the warnings which can be
printed via a call to \code{\LinkA{warnings}{warnings}}.

Warnings will be truncated to \code{\LinkA{getOption}{getOption}("warning.length")}
characters, default 1000, indicated by \code{[... truncated]}.

While the warning is being processed, a \code{muffleWarning} restart
is available.  If this restart is invoked with \code{invokeRestart},
then \code{warning} returns immediately.

An attempt is made to coerce other types of inputs to \code{warning}
to character vectors.

\code{suppressWarnings} evaluates its expression in a context that
ignores all warnings.

Evaluate an \R{} expression in an environment constructed from data,
possibly modifying the original data.
\end{Description}

\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
with(data, expr, ...)
within(data, expr, ...)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{data}] data to use for constructing an environment. For the
default \code{with} method this may be an environment, a list, a
data frame, or an integer as in \code{sys.call}. For \code{within},
it can be a list or a data frame.
\item[\code{expr}] expression to evaluate.
\item[\code{...}] arguments to be passed to future methods.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{with} is a generic function that evaluates \code{expr} in a
local environment constructed from \code{data}.  The environment has
the caller's environment as its parent.  This is useful for
simplifying calls to modeling functions.  (Note: if \code{data} is
already an environment then this is used with its existing parent.)

Note that assignments within \code{expr} take place in the constructed
environment and not in the user's workspace.

\code{within} is similar, except that it examines the environment
after the evaluation of \code{expr} and makes the corresponding
modifications to \code{data} (this may fail in the data frame case if
objects are created which cannot be stored in a data frame), and
returns it.  \code{within} can be used as an alternative to
\code{transform}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
For \code{with}, the value of the evaluated \code{expr}.  For
\code{within}, the modified object.

\begin{Description}\relax
Write text lines to a connection.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
writeLines(text, con = stdout(), sep = "\n", useBytes = FALSE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{text}] A character vector
\item[\code{con}] A \LinkA{connection}{connection} object or a character string.
\item[\code{sep}] character.  A string to be written to the connection after
each line of text.
\item[\code{useBytes}] logical.  See `Details'.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
If the \code{con} is a character string, the function calls
\code{\LinkA{file}{file}} to obtain a file connection which is opened for
the duration of the function call.

If the connection is open it is written from its current position.
If it is not open, it is opened for the duration of the call in
\code{"wt"} mode and then closed again.

Normally \code{writeLines} is used with a text-mode  connection, and the
default separator is converted to the normal separator for that
platform (LF on Unix/Linux, CRLF on Windows).  For more control, open
a binary connection and specify the precise value you want written to
the file in \code{sep}.  For even more control, use
\code{\LinkA{writeChar}{writeChar}} on a binary connection.

\code{useBytes} is for expert use.  Normally (when false) character
strings with marked encodings are converted to the current encoding
before being passed to the connection (which might do further
re-encoding).  \code{useBytes = TRUE} suppresses the re-encoding of
marked strings so they are passed byte-by-byte to the connection:
this can be useful when strings have already been re-encoded by
e.g. \code{\LinkA{iconv}{iconv}}.  (It is invoked automatically for strings
with marked encoding \code{"bytes"}.)

\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
This is a special case of ranking, but as a less general function than
\code{\LinkA{rank}{rank}} is more suitable to be made generic.  The default
method is similar to \code{rank(x, ties.method="min",
    na.last="keep")}, so \code{NA} values are given rank \code{NA} and all
tied values are given equal integer rank.

The \code{\LinkA{factor}{factor}} method extracts the codes.  The
\code{\LinkA{Surv}{Surv}} method sorts first on times and then on
status code(s).

The default method will unclass the object if
\code{\LinkA{is.numeric}{is.numeric}(x)} is true but otherwise make use of
\code{==} and \code{>} methods for the class of \code{x[i]} (for
integers \code{i}), and the \code{is.na} method for the class of
\code{x}, but might be rather slow when doing so.

This is an \LinkA{internal generic}{internal generic} \LinkA{primitive}{primitive}, so S3 or S4
methods can be written for it.
