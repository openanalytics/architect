1 Introduction
**************

Reading data into a statistical system for analysis and exporting the
results to some other system for report writing can be frustrating tasks
that can take far more time than the statistical analysis itself, even
though most readers will find the latter far more appealing.

   This manual describes the import and export facilities available
either in R itself or via packages which are available from CRAN or
elsewhere.

   Unless otherwise stated, everything described in this manual is (at
least in principle) available on all platforms running R.

   In general, statistical systems like R are not particularly well
suited to manipulations of large-scale data.  Some other systems are
better than R at this, and part of the thrust of this manual is to
suggest that rather than duplicating functionality in R we can make
another system do the work!  (For example Therneau & Grambsch (2000)
commented that they preferred to do data manipulation in SAS and then
use package *survival* (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survival) in
S for the analysis.)  Database manipulation systems are often very
suitable for manipulating and extracting data: several packages to
interact with DBMSs are discussed here.

   There are packages to allow functionality developed in languages
such as `Java', `perl' and `python' to be directly integrated with R
code, making the use of facilities in these languages even more
appropriate.  (See the *rJava*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rJava) package from CRAN and the
*SJava*, *RSPerl* and *RSPython* packages from the Omegahat project,
`http://www.omegahat.org'.)

   It is also worth remembering that R like S comes from the Unix
tradition of small re-usable tools, and it can be rewarding to use tools
such as `awk' and `perl' to manipulate data before import or after
export.  The case study in Becker, Chambers & Wilks (1988, Chapter 9)
is an example of this, where Unix tools were used to check and
manipulate the data before input to S. The traditional Unix tools are
now much more widely available, including for Windows.

1.1 Imports
===========

* Menu:

* Encodings::

   The easiest form of data to import into R is a simple text file, and
this will often be acceptable for problems of small or medium scale.
The primary function to import from a text file is `scan', and this
underlies most of the more convenient functions discussed in *note
Spreadsheet-like data::.

   However, all statistical consultants are familiar with being
presented by a client with a memory stick (formerly, a floppy disc or
CD-R) of data in some proprietary binary format, for example `an Excel
spreadsheet' or `an SPSS file'.  Often the simplest thing to do is to
use the originating application to export the data as a text file (and
statistical consultants will have copies of the most common applications
on their computers for that purpose).  However, this is not always
possible, and *note Importing from other statistical systems:: discusses
what facilities are available to access such files directly from R.
For Excel spreadsheets, the available methods are summarized in *note
Reading Excel spreadsheets::.  For ODS spreadsheets from Open Office,
see the Omegahat package(1) *ROpenOffice*.

   In a few cases, data have been stored in a binary form for
compactness and speed of access.  One application of this that we have
seen several times is imaging data, which is normally stored as a
stream of bytes as represented in memory, possibly preceded by a
header.  Such data formats are discussed in *note Binary files:: and
*note Binary connections::.

   For much larger databases it is common to handle the data using a
database management system (DBMS).  There is once again the option of
using the DBMS to extract a plain file, but for many such DBMSs the
extraction operation can be done directly from an R package: *Note
Relational databases::.  Importing data via network connections is
discussed in *note Network interfaces::.

1.1.1 Encodings
---------------

Unless the file to be imported from is entirely in ASCII, it is usually
necessary to know how it was encoded.  For text files, a good way to
find out something about its structure is the `file' command-line tool
(for Windows, included in `Rtools').  This reports something like

     text.Rd: UTF-8 Unicode English text
     text2.dat: ISO-8859 English text
     text3.dat: Little-endian UTF-16 Unicode English character data,
        with CRLF line terminators
     intro.dat: UTF-8 Unicode text
     intro.dat: UTF-8 Unicode (with BOM) text

Modern Unix-alike systems, including Mac OS X, are likely to produce
UTF-8 files.  Windows may produce what it calls `Unicode' files
(`UCS-2LE' or just possibly `UTF-16LE'(1)).  Otherwise most files will
be in a 8-bit encoding unless from a Chinese/Japanese/Korean locale
(which have a wide range of encodings in common use).  It is not
possible to automatically detect with certainty which 8-bit encoding
(although guesses may be possible and `file' may guess as it did in the
example above), so you may simply have to ask the originator for some
clues (e.g. `Russian on Windows').

   `BOMs' (Byte Order Marks,
`http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark') cause problems for
Unicode files.  In the Unix world BOMs are rarely used, whereas in the
Windows world they almost always are for UCS-2/UTF-16 files, and often
are for UTF-8 files.  The `file' utility will not even recognize UCS-2
files without a BOM, but many other utilities will refuse to read files
with a BOM and the IANA standards for `UTF-16LE' and `UTF-16BE'
prohibit it.  We have too often been reduced to looking at the file
with the command-line utility `od' or a hex editor to work out its
encoding.

pairs is very rare.

1.2 Export to text files
========================

Exporting results from R is usually a less contentious task, but there
are still a number of pitfalls.  There will be a target application in
mind, and normally a text file will be the most convenient interchange
vehicle.  (If a binary file is required, see *note Binary files::.)

   Function `cat' underlies the functions for exporting data.  It takes
a `file' argument, and the `append' argument allows a text file to be
written via successive calls to `cat'.  Better, especially if this is
to be done many times, is to open a `file' connection for writing or
appending, and `cat' to that connection, then `close' it.

   The most common task is to write a matrix or data frame to file as a
rectangular grid of numbers, possibly with row and column labels.  This
can be done by the functions `write.table' and `write'.  Function
`write' just writes out a matrix or vector in a specified number of
columns (and transposes a matrix).  Function `write.table' is more
convenient, and writes out a data frame (or an object that can be
coerced to a data frame) with row and column labels.

   There are a number of issues that need to be considered in writing
out a data frame to a text file.

  1. *Precision*

     Most of the conversions of real/complex numbers done by these
     functions is to full precision, but those by `write' are governed
     by the current setting of `options(digits)'.  For more control, use
     `format' on a data frame, possibly column-by-column.

  2. *Header line*

     R prefers the header line to have no entry for the row names, so
     the file looks like

                          dist    climb   time
          Greenmantle     2.5     650     16.083
             ...

     Some other systems require a (possibly empty) entry for the row
     names, which is what `write.table' will provide if argument
     `col.names = NA' is specified.  Excel is one such system.

  3. *Separator* 

     A common field separator to use in the file is a comma, as that is
     unlikely to appear in any of the fields in English-speaking
     countries.  Such files are known as CSV (comma separated values)
     files, and wrapper function `write.csv' provides appropriate
     defaults.  In some locales the comma is used as the decimal point
     (set this in `write.table' by `dec = ","') and there CSV files use
     the semicolon as the field separator: use `write.csv2' for
     appropriate defaults.  There is an IETF standard for CSV files
     (which mandates commas and CRLF line endings, for which use `eol =
     "\r\n"'), RFC4180 (see `http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180'), but
     what is more important in practice is that the file is readable by
     the application it is targeted at.

     Using a semicolon or tab (`sep = "\t"') are probably the safest
     options.

  4. *Missing values* 

     By default missing values are output as `NA', but this may be
     changed by argument `na'.  Note that `NaN's are treated as `NA' by
     `write.table', but not by `cat' nor `write'.

  5. *Quoting strings* 

     By default strings are quoted (including the row and column names).
     Argument `quote' controls if  character and factor variables are
     quoted: some programs, for example *Mondrian*, do not accept quoted
     strings (which are the default).

     Some care is needed if the strings contain embedded quotes.  Three
     useful forms are

          > df <- data.frame(a = I("a \" quote"))
          > write.table(df)
          "a"
          "1" "a \" quote"
          > write.table(df, qmethod = "double")
          "a"
          "1" "a "" quote"
          > write.table(df, quote = FALSE, sep = ",")
          a
          1,a " quote

     The second is the form of escape commonly used by spreadsheets.

  6. *Encodings* 

     Text files do not contain metadata on their encodings, so for
     non-ASCII data the file needs to be targetted to the application
     intended to read it.  All of these functions can write to a
     _connection_ which allows an encoding to be specified for the
     file, and `write.table' has a `fileEncoding' argument to make this
     easier.

     The hard part is to know what file encoding to use.  For use on
     Windows, it is best to use what Windows calls `Unicode'(1), that
     is `"UTF-16LE"'.  Using UTF-8 is a good way to make portable files
     that will not easily be confused with any other encoding, but even
     Mac OS X applications (where UTF-8 is the system encoding) may not
     recognize them, and Windows applications are most unlikely to.
     Apparently Excel:mac 2004/8 expects `.csv' files in `"macroman"'
     encoding (the encoding used in much earlier versions of Mac OS).


   Function `write.matrix' in package *MASS*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MASS) provides a specialized
interface for writing matrices, with the option of writing them in
blocks and thereby reducing memory usage.

   It is possible to use `sink' to divert the standard R output to a
file, and thereby capture the output of (possibly implicit) `print'
statements.  This is not usually the most efficient route, and the
`options(width)' setting may need to be increased.

   Function `write.foreign' in package *foreign*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=foreign) uses `write.table' to
produce a text file and also writes a code file that will read this
text file into another statistical package. There is currently support
for export to `SAS', `SPSS' and `Stata'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Even then, Windows applications may expect a Byte Order Mark
which the implementation of `iconv' used by R may or may not add
depending on the platform.

1.3 XML
=======

When reading data from text files, it is the responsibility of the user
to know and to specify the conventions used to create that file, e.g.
the comment character, whether a header line is present, the value
separator, the representation for missing values (and so on) described
in *note Export to text files::.  A markup language which can be used to
describe not only content but also the structure of the content can
make a file self-describing, so that one need not provide these details
to the software reading the data.

   The eXtensible Markup Language - more commonly known simply as XML -
can be used to provide such structure, not only for standard datasets
but also more complex data structures.  XML is becoming extremely
popular and is emerging as a standard for general data markup and
exchange.  It is being used by different communities to describe
geographical data such as maps, graphical displays, mathematics and so
on.

   XML provides a way to specify the file's encoding, e.g.

     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

although it does not require it.

   The *XML* (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=XML) package provides
general facilities for reading and writing XML documents within R.  A
description of the facilities of the *XML*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=XML) package is outside the scope of
this document: see the package's Web page at
`http://www.omegahat.org/RSXML' for details and examples.  Package
*StatDataML* (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=StatDataML) on CRAN is
one example building on *XML* (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=XML).

   NB: *XML* (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=XML) is available as a
binary package for Windows, normally from the `CRAN extras' repository
(which is selected by default on Windows).

section we consider importing such files into R.


File: R-data.info,  Node: Variations on read.table,  Next: Fixed-width-format files,  Prev: Spreadsheet-like data,  Up: Spreadsheet-like data

2.1 Variations on `read.table'
==============================

The function `read.table' is the most convenient way to read in a
rectangular grid of data.  Because of the many possibilities, there are
several other functions that call `read.table' but change a group of
default arguments.

   Beware that `read.table' is an inefficient way to read in very large
numerical matrices: see `scan' below.

   Some of the issues to consider are:

  1. *Encoding*

     If the file contains non-ASCII character fields, ensure that it is
     read in the correct encoding.  This is mainly an issue for reading
     Latin-1 files in a UTF-8 locale, which can be done by something
     like

          read.table("file.dat", fileEncoding="latin1")

     Note that this will work in any locale which can represent Latin-1
     strings, but not many Greek/Russian/Chinese/Japanese ... locales.

  2. *Header line*

     We recommend that you specify the `header' argument explicitly,
     Conventionally the header line has entries only for the columns
     and not for the row labels, so is one field shorter than the
     remaining lines.  (If R sees this, it sets `header = TRUE'.)  If
     presented with a file that has a (possibly empty) header field for
     the row labels, read it in by something like

          read.table("file.dat", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)

     Column names can be given explicitly via the `col.names'; explicit
     names override the header line (if present).

  3. *Separator*

     Normally looking at the file will determine the field separator to
     be used, but with white-space separated files there may be a
     choice between the default `sep = ""' which uses any white space
     (spaces, tabs or newlines) as a separator, `sep = " "' and `sep =
     "\t"'.  Note that the choice of separator affects the input of
     quoted strings.

     If you have a tab-delimited file containing empty fields be sure
     to use `sep = "\t"'.

  4. *Quoting* 

     By default character strings can be quoted by either `"' or `'',
     and in each case all the characters up to a matching quote are
     taken as part of the character string.  The set of valid quoting
     characters (which might be none) is controlled by the `quote'
     argument.  For `sep = "\n"' the default is changed to `quote = ""'.

     If no separator character is specified, quotes can be escaped
     within quoted strings by immediately preceding them by `\',
     C-style.

     If a separator character is specified, quotes can be escaped within
     quoted strings by doubling them as is conventional in
     spreadsheets.  For example

          'One string isn''t two',"one more"

     can be read by

          read.table("testfile", sep = ",")

     This does not work with the default separator.

  5. *Missing values* 

     By default the file is assumed to contain the character string `NA'
     to represent missing values, but this can be changed by the
     argument `na.strings', which is a vector of one or more character
     representations of missing values.

     Empty fields in numeric columns are also regarded as missing
     values.

     In numeric columns, the values `NaN', `Inf' and `-Inf' are
     accepted.

  6. *Unfilled lines*

     It is quite common for a file exported from a spreadsheet to have
     all trailing empty fields (and their separators) omitted.  To read
     such files set `fill = TRUE'.

  7. *White space in character fields*

     If a separator is specified, leading and trailing white space in
     character fields is regarded as part of the field.  To strip the
     space, use argument `strip.white = TRUE'.

  8. *Blank lines*

     By default, `read.table' ignores empty lines.  This can be changed
     by setting `blank.lines.skip = FALSE', which will only be useful in
     conjunction with `fill = TRUE', perhaps to use blank rows to
     indicate missing cases in a regular layout.

  9. *Classes for the variables*

     Unless you take any special action, `read.table' reads all the
     columns as character vectors and then tries to select a suitable
     class for each variable in the data frame.  It tries in turn
     `logical', `integer', `numeric' and `complex', moving on if any
     entry is not missing and cannot be converted.(1) If all of these
     fail, the variable is converted to a factor.

     Arguments `colClasses' and `as.is' provide greater control.
     Specifying `as.is = TRUE' suppresses conversion of character
     vectors to factors (only).  Using `colClasses' allows the desired
     class to be set for each column in the input: it will be faster
     and use less memory.

     Note that `colClasses' and `as.is' are specified _per_ column, not
     _per_ variable, and so include the column of row names (if any).

 10. *Comments*

     By default, `read.table' uses `#' as a comment character, and if
     this is encountered (except in quoted strings) the rest of the
     line is ignored. Lines containing only white space and a comment
     are treated as blank lines.

     If it is known that there will be no comments in the data file, it
     is safer (and may be faster) to use `comment.char = ""'.

 11. *Escapes*

     Many OSes have conventions for using backslash as an escape
     character in text files, but Windows does not (and uses backslash
     in path names).  It is optional in R whether such conventions are
     applied to data files.

     Both `read.table' and `scan' have a logical argument
     `allowEscapes'.  This is false by default, and backslashes are then
     only interpreted as (under circumstances described above) escaping
     quotes.  If this set to be true, C-style escapes are interpreted,
     namely the control characters `\a, \b, \f, \n, \r, \t, \v' and
     octal and hexadecimal representations like `\040' and `\0x2A'.  Any
     other escaped character is treated as itself, including backslash.
     Note that Unicode escapes such as `\uXXXX' are never interpreted.

 12. *Encoding*

     This can be specified by the `fileEncoding' argument, for example

          fileEncoding = "UCS-2LE"    # Windows 'Unicode' files
          fileEncoding = "UTF-8"

     If you know (correctly) the file's encoding this will almost always
     work.  However, we know of one exception, UTF-8 files with a BOM.
     Some people claim that UTF-8 files should never have a BOM, but
     some software (apparently including Excel:mac) uses them, and many
     Unix-alike OSes do not accept them.  So faced with a file which
     `file' reports as

          intro.dat: UTF-8 Unicode (with BOM) text

     it can be read on Windows by

          read.table("intro.dat", fileEncoding = "UTF-8")

     but in a UTF-8 locale on a Unix-alike is likely to need

          con <- file("intro.dat", "r")
          seek(con, 3)  # step over the 3 initial bytes, the BOM
          foo <- read.table(con)
          close(con)

     Another problem with this (real-life) example is that whereas
     `file-5.03' reported the BOM, `file-4.17' found on Mac OS 10.5
     (Leopard) did not.

   Convenience functions `read.csv' and `read.delim' provide arguments
to `read.table' appropriate for CSV and tab-delimited files exported
from spreadsheets in English-speaking locales.  The variations
`read.csv2' and `read.delim2' are appropriate for use in those locales
where the comma is used for the decimal point and (for `read.csv2') for
spreadsheets which use semicolons to separate fields.

   If the options to `read.table' are specified incorrectly, the error
message will usually be of the form

     Error in scan(file = file, what = what, sep = sep, :
             line 1 did not have 5 elements

or

     Error in read.table("files.dat", header = TRUE) :
             more columns than column names

This may give enough information to find the problem, but the auxiliary
function `count.fields' can be useful to investigate further.

   Efficiency can be important when reading large data grids.  It will
help to specify `comment.char = ""', `colClasses' as one of the atomic
vector types (logical, integer, numeric, complex, character or perhaps
raw) for each column, and to give `nrows', the number of rows to be
read (and a mild over-estimate is better than not specifying this at
all).  See the examples in later sections.

2.2 Fixed-width-format files
============================

Sometimes data files have no field delimiters but have fields in
pre-specified columns.  This was very common in the days of punched
cards, and is still sometimes used to save file space.

   Function `read.fwf' provides a simple way to read such files,
specifying a vector of field widths.  The function reads the file into
memory as whole lines, splits the resulting character strings, writes
out a temporary tab-separated file and then calls `read.table'.  This
is adequate for small files, but for anything more complicated we
recommend using the facilities of a language like `perl' to pre-process
the file.  

   Function `read.fortran' is a similar function for fixed-format files,
using Fortran-style column specifications.

2.3 Data Interchange Format (DIF)
=================================

An old format sometimes used for spreadsheet-like data is DIF, or Data
Interchange format.

   Function `read.DIF' provides a simple way to read such files.  It
takes arguments similar to `read.table' for assigning types to each of
the columns.

   On Windows, spreadsheet programs often store spreadsheet data copied
to the clipboard in this format; `read.DIF("clipboard")' can read it
from there directly.  It is slightly more robust than
`read.table("clipboard")' in handling spreadsheets with empty cells.


File: R-data.info,  Node: Using scan directly,  Next: Re-shaping data,  Prev: Data Interchange Format (DIF),  Up: Spreadsheet-like data

2.4 Using `scan' directly
=========================

Both `read.table' and `read.fwf' use `scan' to read the file, and then
process the results of `scan'.  They are very convenient, but sometimes
it is better to use `scan' directly.

   Function `scan' has many arguments, most of which we have already
covered under `read.table'.  The most crucial argument is `what', which
specifies a list of modes of variables to be read from the file.  If
the list is named, the names are used for the components of the
returned list.  Modes can be numeric, character or complex, and are
usually specified by an example, e.g. `0', `""' or `0i'.  For example

     cat("2 3 5 7", "11 13 17 19", file="ex.dat", sep="\n")
     scan(file="ex.dat", what=list(x=0, y="", z=0), flush=TRUE)

returns a list with three components and discards the fourth column in
the file.

   There is a function `readLines' which will be more convenient if all
you want is to read whole lines into R for further processing.

   One common use of `scan' is to read in a large matrix.  Suppose file
`matrix.dat' just contains the numbers for a 200 x 2000 matrix. Then we
can use

     A <- matrix(scan("matrix.dat", n = 200*2000), 200, 2000, byrow = TRUE)

On one test this took 1 second (under Linux, 3 seconds under Windows on
the same machine) whereas

     A <- as.matrix(read.table("matrix.dat"))

took 10 seconds (and more memory), and

     A <- as.matrix(read.table("matrix.dat", header = FALSE, nrows = 200,
                               comment.char = "", colClasses = "numeric"))

took 7 seconds.  The difference is almost entirely due to the overhead
of reading 2000 separate short columns: were they of length 2000,
`scan' took 9 seconds whereas `read.table' took 18 if used efficiently
(in particular, specifying `colClasses') and 125 if used naively.

   Note that timings can depend on the type read and the data.
Consider reading a million distinct integers:
     writeLines(as.character((1+1e6):2e6), "ints.dat")
     xi <- scan("ints.dat", what=integer(0), n=1e6)   # 0.77s
     xn <- scan("ints.dat", what=numeric(0), n=1e6)   # 0.93s
     xc <- scan("ints.dat", what=character(0), n=1e6) # 0.85s
     xf <- as.factor(xc)                              # 2.2s
     DF <- read.table("ints.dat")                     # 4.5s
   and a million examples of a small set of codes:
     code <- c("LMH", "SJC", "CHCH", "SPC", "SOM")
     writeLines(sample(code, 1e6, replace=TRUE), "code.dat")
     y <- scan("code.dat", what=character(0), n=1e6)  # 0.44s
     yf <- as.factor(y)                               # 0.21s
     DF <- read.table("code.dat")                     # 4.9s
     DF <- read.table("code.dat", nrows=1e6)          # 3.6s

   Note that these timings depend heavily on the operating system (the
basic reads in Windows take at least as twice as long as these Linux
times) and on the precise state of the garbage collector.

2.5 Re-shaping data
===================

Sometimes spreadsheet data is in a compact format that gives the
covariates for each subject followed by all the observations on that
subject.  R's modelling functions need observations in a single column.
Consider the following sample of data from repeated MRI brain
measurements

      Status   Age    V1     V2     V3    V4
           P 23646 45190  50333  55166 56271
          CC 26174 35535  38227  37911 41184
          CC 27723 25691  25712  26144 26398
          CC 27193 30949  29693  29754 30772
          CC 24370 50542  51966  54341 54273
          CC 28359 58591  58803  59435 61292
          CC 25136 45801  45389  47197 47126

There are two covariates and up to four measurements on each subject.
The data were exported from Excel as a file `mr.csv'.

   We can use `stack' to help manipulate these data to give a single
response.

     zz <- read.csv("mr.csv", strip.white = TRUE)
     zzz <- cbind(zz[gl(nrow(zz), 1, 4*nrow(zz)), 1:2], stack(zz[, 3:6]))

with result

           Status   Age values ind
     X1         P 23646  45190  V1
     X2        CC 26174  35535  V1
     X3        CC 27723  25691  V1
     X4        CC 27193  30949  V1
     X5        CC 24370  50542  V1
     X6        CC 28359  58591  V1
     X7        CC 25136  45801  V1
     X11        P 23646  50333  V2
     ...

   Function `unstack' goes in the opposite direction, and may be useful
for exporting data.

   Another way to do this is to use the function `reshape', by

     > reshape(zz, idvar="id",timevar="var",
       varying=list(c("V1","V2","V3","V4")),direction="long")
         Status   Age var    V1 id
     1.1      P 23646   1 45190  1
     2.1     CC 26174   1 35535  2
     3.1     CC 27723   1 25691  3
     4.1     CC 27193   1 30949  4
     5.1     CC 24370   1 50542  5
     6.1     CC 28359   1 58591  6
     7.1     CC 25136   1 45801  7
     1.2      P 23646   2 50333  1
     2.2     CC 26174   2 38227  2
     ...

   The `reshape' function has a more complicated syntax than `stack'
but can be used for data where the `long' form has more than the one
column in this example. With `direction="wide"', `reshape' can also
perform the opposite transformation.

   Some people prefer the tools in packages *reshape*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=reshape), *reshape2*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=reshape2) and *plyr*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=plyr).


File: R-data.info,  Node: Flat contingency tables,  Prev: Re-shaping data,  Up: Spreadsheet-like data

2.6 Flat contingency tables
===========================

Displaying higher-dimensional contingency tables in array form typically
is rather inconvenient.  In categorical data analysis, such information
is often represented in the form of bordered two-dimensional arrays with
leading rows and columns specifying the combination of factor levels
corresponding to the cell counts.  These rows and columns are typically
"ragged" in the sense that labels are only displayed when they change,
with the obvious convention that rows are read from top to bottom and
columns are read from left to right.  In R, such "flat" contingency
tables can be created using `ftable', which creates objects of class
`"ftable"' with an appropriate print method.

   As a simple example, consider the R standard data set
`UCBAdmissions' which is a 3-dimensional contingency table resulting
from classifying applicants to graduate school at UC Berkeley for the
six largest departments in 1973 classified by admission and sex.

     > data(UCBAdmissions)
     > ftable(UCBAdmissions)
                     Dept   A   B   C   D   E   F
     Admit    Gender
     Admitted Male        512 353 120 138  53  22
              Female       89  17 202 131  94  24
     Rejected Male        313 207 205 279 138 351
              Female       19   8 391 244 299 317

The printed representation is clearly more useful than displaying the
data as a 3-dimensional array.

   There is also a function `read.ftable' for reading in flat-like
contingency tables from files.  This has additional arguments for
dealing with variants on how exactly the information on row and column
variables names and levels is represented.  The help page for
`read.ftable' has some useful examples.  The flat tables can be
converted to standard contingency tables in array form using `as.table'.

   Note that flat tables are characterized by their "ragged" display of
row (and maybe also column) labels.  If the full grid of levels of the
row variables is given, one should instead use `read.table' to read in
the data, and create the contingency table from this using `xtabs'.

3 Importing from other statistical systems
******************************************

In this chapter we consider the problem of reading a binary data file
written by another statistical system.  This is often best avoided, but
may be unavoidable if the originating system is not available.

   In all cases the facilities described were written for data files
from specific versions of the other system (often in the early 2000s),
and have not necessarily been updated for the most recent versions of
the other system.

* Menu:

* EpiInfo Minitab SAS S-PLUS SPSS Stata Systat::
* Octave::


File: R-data.info,  Node: EpiInfo Minitab SAS S-PLUS SPSS Stata Systat,  Next: Octave,  Prev: Importing from other statistical systems,  Up: Importing from other statistical systems

3.1 EpiInfo, Minitab, S-PLUS, SAS, SPSS, Stata, Systat
======================================================

The recommended package *foreign*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=foreign) provides import facilities
for files produced by these statistical systems, and for export to
Stata. In some cases these functions may require substantially less
memory than `read.table' would. `write.foreign' (See *note Export to
text files::) provides an export mechanism with support currently for
`SAS', `SPSS' and `Stata'.

   EpiInfo versions 5 and 6 stored data in a  self-describing
fixed-width text format. `read.epiinfo' will read these `.REC' files
into an R data frame. EpiData also produces data in this format.

   Function `read.mtp' imports a `Minitab Portable Worksheet'.  This
returns the components of the worksheet as an R list.

   Function `read.xport' reads a file in SAS Transport (XPORT) format
and return a list of data frames.  If SAS is available on your system,
function `read.ssd' can be used to create and run a SAS script that
saves a SAS permanent dataset (`.ssd' or `.sas7bdat') in Transport
format.  It then calls `read.xport' to read the resulting file.
(Package *Hmisc* (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Hmisc) has a
similar function `sas.get', also running SAS.)  For those without
access to SAS but running on Windows, the SAS System Viewer (a
zero-cost download) can be used to open SAS datasets and export them to
e.g. `.csv' format.

   Function `read.S' which can read binary objects produced by S-PLUS
3.x, 4.x or 2000 on (32-bit) Unix or Windows (and can read them on a
different OS).  This is able to read many but not all S objects: in
particular it can read vectors, matrices and data frames and lists
containing those.

   Function `data.restore' reads S-PLUS data dumps (created by
`data.dump') with the same restrictions (except that dumps from the
Alpha platform can also be read).  It should be possible to read data
dumps from S-PLUS 5.x and later written with `data.dump(oldStyle=T)'.

   If you have access to S-PLUS, it is usually more reliable to `dump'
the object(s) in S-PLUS and `source' the dump file in R.  For S-PLUS
5.x and later you may need to use `dump(..., oldStyle=T)', and to read
in very large objects it may be preferable to use the dump file as a
batch script rather than use the `source' function.

   Function `read.spss' can read files created by the `save' and
`export' commands in SPSS.  It returns a list with one component for
each variable in the saved data set. SPSS variables with value labels
are optionally converted to R factors.

   SPSS Data Entry is an application for creating data entry forms.  By
default it creates data files with extra formatting information that
`read.spss' cannot handle, but it is possible to export the data in an
ordinary SPSS format.

   Some third-party applications claim to produce data `in SPSS format'
but with differences in the formats: `read.spss' may or may not be able
to handle these.

   Stata `.dta' files are a binary file format. Files from versions 5
up to 11 of Stata can be read and written by functions `read.dta' and
`write.dta'.  Stata variables with value labels are optionally
converted to (and from) R factors.  Stata version 12 by default writes
`format-115 datasets': `read.dta' currently may not be able to read
those.

   `read.systat' reads those Systat `SAVE' files that are rectangular
data files (`mtype = 1') written on little-endian machines (such as
from Windows).  These have extension `.sys' or (more recently) `.syd'.

3.2 Octave
==========

Octave is a numerical linear algebra system (`http://www.octave.org'),
and function `read.octave' in package *foreign*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=foreign) can read in files in Octave
text data format created using the Octave command `save -ascii', with
support for most of the common types of variables, including the
standard atomic (real and complex scalars, matrices, and N-d arrays,
strings, ranges, and boolean scalars and matrices) and recursive
(structs, cells, and lists) ones.

4.1 Why use a database?
=======================

There are limitations on the types of data that R handles well.  Since
all data being manipulated by R are resident in memory, and several
copies of the data can be created during execution of a function, R is
not well suited to extremely large data sets.  Data objects that are
more than a (few) hundred megabytes in size can cause R to run out of
memory, particularly on a 32-bit operating system.

   R does not easily support concurrent access to data.  That is, if
more than one user is accessing, and perhaps updating, the same data,
the changes made by one user will not be visible to the others.

   R does support persistence of data, in that you can save a data
object or an entire worksheet from one session and restore it at the
subsequent session, but the format of the stored data is specific to R
and not easily manipulated by other systems.

   Database management systems (DBMSs) and, in particular, relational
DBMSs (RDBMSs) _are_ designed to do all of these things well.  Their
strengths are

  1. To provide fast access to selected parts of large databases.

  2. Powerful ways to summarize and cross-tabulate columns in databases.

  3. Store data in more organized ways than the rectangular grid model
     of spreadsheets and R data frames.

  4. Concurrent access from multiple clients running on multiple hosts
     while enforcing security constraints on access to the data.

  5. Ability to act as a server to a wide range of clients.

   The sort of statistical applications for which DBMS might be used
are to extract a 10% sample of the data, to cross-tabulate data to
produce a multi-dimensional contingency table, and to extract data
group by group from a database for separate analysis.

   Increasingly OSes are themselves making use of DBMSs for these
reasons, so it is nowadays likely that one will be already installed on
your (non-Windows) OS.  Akonadi (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akonadi)
is used by KDE4 to store personal information and uses MySQL.  Several
Mac OS X applications, including Mail and Address Book, use SQLite.

4.2 Overview of RDBMSs
======================

Traditionally there had been large (and expensive) commercial RDBMSs
(Informix (http://www.informix.com); Oracle (http://www.oracle.com);
Sybase (http://www.sybase.com); IBM's DB2 (http://www.ibm.com/db2);
Microsoft SQL Server (http://www.microsoft.com/SQL/default.mspx) on
Windows) and academic and small-system databases (such as MySQL,
PostgreSQL, Microsoft Access, ...), the former marked out by much
greater emphasis on data security features.  The line is blurring, with
the Open Source MySQL and PostgreSQL having more and more high-end
features, and free `express' versions being made available for the
commercial DBMSs.

   There are other commonly used data sources, including spreadsheets,
non-relational databases and even text files (possibly compressed).
Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is a standard to use all of these
data sources.  It originated on Windows (see
`http://www.microsoft.com/data/odbc/') but is also implemented on
Linux/Unix/Mac OS X.

   All of the packages described later in this chapter provide clients
to client/server databases.  The database can reside on the same
machine or (more often) remotely.  There is an ISO standard (in fact
several: SQL92 is ISO/IEC 9075, also known as ANSI X3.135-1992, and
SQL99 is coming into use) for an interface language called SQL
(Structured Query Language, sometimes pronounced `sequel': see Bowman
_et al._ 1996 and Kline and Kline 2001) which these DBMSs support to
varying degrees.

* Menu:

* SQL queries::
* Data types::


File: R-data.info,  Node: SQL queries,  Next: Data types,  Prev: Overview of RDBMSs,  Up: Overview of RDBMSs

4.2.1 SQL queries
-----------------

The more comprehensive R interfaces generate SQL behind the scenes for
common operations, but direct use of SQL is needed for complex
operations in all.  Conventionally SQL is written in upper case, but
many users will find it more convenient to use lower case in the R
interface functions.

   A relational DBMS stores data as a database of _tables_ (or
_relations_) which are rather similar to R data frames, in that they
are made up of _columns_ or _fields_ of one type (numeric, character,
date, currency, ...) and _rows_ or _records_ containing the
observations for one entity.

   SQL `queries' are quite general operations on a relational database.
The classical query is a SELECT statement of the type

     SELECT State, Murder FROM USArrests WHERE Rape > 30 ORDER BY Murder

     SELECT t.sch, c.meanses, t.sex, t.achieve
       FROM student as t, school as c WHERE t.sch = c.id

     SELECT sex, COUNT(*) FROM student GROUP BY sex

     SELECT sch, AVG(sestat) FROM student GROUP BY sch LIMIT 10

The first of these selects two columns from the R data frame
`USArrests' that has been copied across to a database table, subsets on
a third column and asks the results be sorted.  The second performs a
database _join_ on two tables `student' and `school' and returns four
columns.  The third and fourth queries do some cross-tabulation and
return counts or averages.  (The five aggregation functions are
COUNT(*) and SUM, MAX, MIN and AVG, each applied to a single column.)

   SELECT queries use FROM to select the table, WHERE to specify a
condition for inclusion (or more than one condition separated by AND or
OR), and ORDER BY to sort the result.  Unlike data frames, rows in RDBMS
tables are best thought of as unordered, and without an ORDER BY
statement the ordering is indeterminate.  You can sort (in
lexicographical order) on more than one column by separating them by
commas.  Placing DESC after an ORDER BY puts the sort in descending
order.

   SELECT DISTINCT queries will only return one copy of each distinct
row in the selected table.

   The GROUP BY clause selects subgroups of the rows according to the
criterion.  If more than one column is specified (separated by commas)
then multi-way cross-classifications can be summarized by one of the
five aggregation functions.  A HAVING clause allows the select to
include or exclude groups depending on the aggregated value.

   If the SELECT statement contains an ORDER BY statement that produces
a unique ordering, a LIMIT clause can be added to select (by number) a
contiguous block of output rows.  This can be useful to retrieve rows a
block at a time.  (It may not be reliable unless the ordering is unique,
as the LIMIT clause can be used to optimize the query.)

   There are queries to create a table (CREATE TABLE, but usually one
copies a data frame to the database in these interfaces), INSERT or
DELETE or UPDATE data.  A table is destroyed by a DROP TABLE `query'.

   Kline and Kline (2001) discuss the details of the implementation of
SQL in Microsoft SQL Server 2000, Oracle, MySQL and PostgreSQL.


File: R-data.info,  Node: Data types,  Prev: SQL queries,  Up: Overview of RDBMSs

4.2.2 Data types
----------------

Data can be stored in a database in various data types.  The range of
data types is DBMS-specific, but the SQL standard defines many types,
including the following that are widely implemented (often not by the
SQL name).

`float(P)'
     Real number, with optional precision.  Often called `real' or
     `double' or `double precision'.

`integer'
     32-bit integer.  Often called `int'.

`smallint'
     16-bit integer

`character(N)'
     fixed-length character string.  Often called `char'.

`character varying(N)'
     variable-length character string.  Often called `varchar'.  Almost
     always has a limit of 255 chars.

`boolean'
     true or false.  Sometimes called `bool' or `bit'.

`date'
     calendar date

`time'
     time of day

`timestamp'
     date and time

There are variants on `time' and `timestamp', `with timezone'.  Other
types widely implemented are `text' and `blob', for large blocks of
text and binary data, respectively.

   The more comprehensive of the R interface packages hide the type
conversion issues from the user.

4.3 R interface packages
========================

There are several packages available on CRAN to help R communicate with
DBMSs.  They provide different levels of abstraction.  Some provide
means to copy whole data frames to and from databases.  All have
functions to select data within the database via SQL queries, and to
retrieve the result as a whole as a data frame or in pieces (usually as
groups of rows).

   All except *RODBC* (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RODBC) are
tied to one DBMS, but there has been a proposal for a unified
`front-end' package *DBI* (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=DBI)
(`http://developer.r-project.org/db') in conjunction with a `back-end',
the most developed of which is *RMySQL*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RMySQL).  Also on CRAN are the
back-ends *ROracle* (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ROracle),
*RPostgreSQL* (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPostgreSQL) and
*RSQLite* (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RSQLite) (which works with
the bundled DBMS `SQLite', `http://www.sqlite.org'),  *RJDBC*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RJDBC) (which uses Java and can
connect to any DBMS that has a JDBC driver) and *RpgSQL*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RpgSQL) (a specialist interface to
PostgreSQL built on top of *RJBDC*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RJBDC)).

   The BioConductor project has updated *RdbiPgSQL* (formerly on CRAN
ca 2000), a first-generation interface to PostgreSQL.

   *PL/R* (`http://www.joeconway.com/plr/'
(http://www.joeconway.com/plr/)) is a project to embed R into
PostgreSQL.

   Package *RMongo* (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RMongo) provides
an R interface to a Java client for `MongoDB'
(`http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB') databases, which are queried
using JavaScript rather than SQL.  Package *rmongodb*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rmongodb) is another client using
*mongodb*'s C driver.

4.3.1 Packages using DBI
------------------------

Package *RMySQL* (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RMySQL) on CRAN
provides an interface to the MySQL database system (see
`http://www.mysql.com' and Dubois, 2000).  The description here applies
to version `0.5-0': earlier versions had a substantially different
interface.  The current version requires the *DBI*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=DBI) package, and this description
will apply with minor changes to all the other back-ends to *DBI*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=DBI).

   MySQL exists on Unix/Linux/Mac OS X and Windows: there is a
`Community Edition' released under GPL but commercial licenses are also
available.  MySQL was originally a `light and lean' database.  (It
preserves the case of names where the operating file system is
case-sensitive, so not on Windows.)

   The call `dbDriver("MySQL")' returns a database connection manager
object, and then a call to `dbConnect' opens a database connection
which can subsequently be closed by a call to the generic function
`dbDisconnect'.  Use `dbDriver("Oracle")', `dbDriver("PostgreSQL")' or
`dbDriver("SQLite")' with those DBMSs and packages *ROracle*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ROracle), *RPostgreSQL*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPostgreSQL) or *RSQLite*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RSQLite) respectively.

   SQL queries can be sent by either `dbSendQuery' or `dbGetQuery'.
`dbGetquery' sends the query and retrieves the results as a data frame.
`dbSendQuery' sends the query and returns an object of class inheriting
from `"DBIResult"' which can be used to retrieve the results, and
subsequently used in a call to `dbClearResult' to remove the result.

   Function `fetch' is used to retrieve some or all of the rows in the
query result, as a list.  The function `dbHasCompleted' indicates if
all the rows have been fetched, and `dbGetRowCount' returns the number
of rows in the result.

   These are convenient interfaces to read/write/test/delete tables in
the database.  `dbReadTable' and `dbWriteTable' copy to and from an R
data frame, mapping the row names of the data frame to the field
`row_names' in the `MySQL' table.

4.3.2 Package RODBC
-------------------

Package *RODBC* (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RODBC) on CRAN
provides an interface to database sources supporting an ODBC interface.
This is very widely available, and allows the same R code to access
different database systems.  *RODBC*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RODBC) runs on Unix/Linux, Windows
and Mac OS X, and almost all database systems provide support for ODBC.
We have tested Microsoft SQL Server, Access, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle
and IBM DB2 on Windows and MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL and SQLite on
Linux.

   ODBC is a client-server system, and we have happily connected to a
DBMS running on a Unix server from a Windows client, and _vice versa_.

   On Windows ODBC support is part of the OS.  On Unix/Linux you will
need an ODBC Driver Manager such as unixODBC
(`http://www.unixODBC.org') or iOBDC (`http://www.iODBC.org': this is
pre-installed in Mac OS X) and an installed driver for your database
system.

   Windows provides drivers not just for DBMSs but also for Excel
(`.xls') spreadsheets, DBase (`.dbf') files and even text files.  (The
named applications do _not_ need to be installed. Which file formats
are supported depends on the the versions of the drivers.)  There are
versions for Excel and Access 2007/2010 (go to
`http://download.microsoft.com', and search for `Office ODBC', which
will lead to `AccessDatabaseEngine.exe'), the `2007 Office System
Driver' (the latter has a version for 64-bit Windows, and that will
also read earlier versions).

   On Mac OS X the Actual Technologies
(`http://www.actualtechnologies.com/product_access.php') drivers
provide ODBC interfaces to Access databases (including Access 2007/2010)
and to Excel spreadsheets (not including Excel 2007/2010).

   Many simultaneous connections are possible.  A connection is opened
by a call to `odbcConnect' or `odbcDriverConnect' (which on the Windows
GUI allows a database to be selected via dialog boxes) which returns a
handle used for subsequent access to the database.  Printing a
connection will provide some details of the ODBC connection, and calling
`odbcGetInfo' will give details on the client and server.

   A connection is closed by a call to `close' or `odbcClose', and also
(with a warning) when not R object refers to it and at the end of an R
session.

   Details of the tables on a connection can be found using `sqlTables'.

   Function `sqlSave' copies an R data frame to a table in the
database, and `sqlFetch' copies a table in the database to an R data
frame.

   An SQL query can be sent to the database by a call to `sqlQuery'.
This returns the result in an R data frame.  (`sqlCopy' sends a query
to the database and saves the result as a table in the database.)  A
finer level of control is attained by first calling `odbcQuery' and
then `sqlGetResults' to fetch the results.  The latter can be used
within a loop to retrieve a limited number of rows at a time, as can
function `sqlFetchMore'.

   Here is an example using PostgreSQL, for which the ODBC driver maps
column and data frame names to lower case.  We use a database `testdb'
we created earlier, and had the DSN (data source name) set up in
`~/.odbc.ini' under `unixODBC'.  Exactly the same code worked using
MyODBC to access a MySQL database under Linux or Windows (where MySQL
also maps names to lowercase).  Under Windows, DSNs are set up in the
ODBC applet in the Control Panel (`Data Sources (ODBC)' in the
`Administrative Tools' section).  

     > library(RODBC)
     ## tell it to map names to l/case
     > channel <- odbcConnect("testdb", uid="ripley", case="tolower")
     ## load a data frame into the database
     > data(USArrests)
     > sqlSave(channel, USArrests, rownames = "state", addPK = TRUE)
     > rm(USArrests)
     ## list the tables in the database
     > sqlTables(channel)
       TABLE_QUALIFIER TABLE_OWNER TABLE_NAME TABLE_TYPE REMARKS
     1                              usarrests      TABLE
     ## list it
     > sqlFetch(channel, "USArrests", rownames = "state")

     Alabama          13.2     236       58 21.2
     Alaska           10.0     263       48 44.5
         ...
     ## an SQL query, originally on one line
     > sqlQuery(channel, "select state, murder from USArrests
                where rape > 30 order by murder")
            state murder
     1 Colorado      7.9
     2 Arizona       8.1
     3 California    9.0
     4 Alaska       10.0
     5 New Mexico   11.4
     6 Michigan     12.1
     7 Nevada       12.2
     8 Florida      15.4
     ## remove the table
     > sqlDrop(channel, "USArrests")
     ## close the connection
     > odbcClose(channel)

   As a simple example of using ODBC under Windows with a Excel
spreadsheet, we can read from a spreadsheet by

     > library(RODBC)
     > channel <- odbcConnectExcel("bdr.xls")
     ## list the spreadsheets
     > sqlTables(channel)
       TABLE_CAT TABLE_SCHEM        TABLE_NAME   TABLE_TYPE REMARKS
     1 C:\\bdr            NA           Sheet1$ SYSTEM TABLE      NA
     2 C:\\bdr            NA           Sheet2$ SYSTEM TABLE      NA
     3 C:\\bdr            NA           Sheet3$ SYSTEM TABLE      NA
     4 C:\\bdr            NA Sheet1$Print_Area        TABLE      NA
     ## retrieve the contents of sheet 1, by either of
     > sh1 <- sqlFetch(channel, "Sheet1")
     > sh1 <- sqlQuery(channel, "select * from [Sheet1$]")

Notice that the specification of the table is different from the name
returned by `sqlTables': `sqlFetch' is able to map the differences.

5.1 Binary data formats
=======================

Packages *hdf5* (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hdf5), *h5r*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=h5r), Bioconductor's *rhdf5*,
*RNetCDF* (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RNetCDF), *ncdf*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ncdf) and *ncdf4*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ncdf4) on CRAN provide interfaces to
NASA's HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format, see
`http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/') and to UCAR's netCDF data files
(network Common Data Form, see
`http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/').

   Both of these are systems to store scientific data in array-oriented
ways, including descriptions, labels, formats, units, ....  HDF5 also
allows _groups_ of arrays, and the R interface maps lists to HDF5
groups, and can write numeric and character vectors and matrices.

   NetCDF's version 4 format (confusingly, implemented in netCDF 4.1.1
and later, but not in 4.0.1) includes the use of various HDF5 formats.
This is handled by package *ncdf4*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ncdf4) whereas *RNetCDF*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RNetCDF) and *ncdf*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ncdf) handle version 3 files.

   The availability of software to support these formats is somewhat
limited by platform, especially on Windows.

5.2 dBase files (DBF)
=====================

`dBase' was a DOS program written by Ashton-Tate and later owned by
Borland which has a binary flat-file format that became popular, with
file extension `.dbf'.  It has been adopted for the 'Xbase' family of
databases, covering dBase, Clipper, FoxPro and their Windows
equivalents Visual dBase, Visual Objects and Visual FoxPro (see
`http://www.e-bachmann.dk/docs/xbase.htm').  A dBase file contains a
header and then a series of fields and so is most similar to an R data
frame.  The data itself is stored in text format, and can include
character, logical and numeric fields, and other types in later versions
(see `http://clicketyclick.dk/docs/data_types.html').

   Functions `read.dbf' and `write.dbf' provide ways to read and write
basic DBF files on all R platforms.  For Windows users
`odbcConnectDbase' in package *RODBC*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RODBC) provides more comprehensive
facilities to read DBF files _via_ Microsoft's dBase ODBC driver (and
the Visual FoxPro driver can also be used via `odbcDriverConnect').

6 Connections
*************

_Connections_ are used in R in the sense of Chambers (1998) and Ripley
(2001), a set of functions to replace the use of file names by a
flexible interface to file-like objects.

* Types of connections::
* Output to connections::

File: R-data.info,  Node: Types of connections,  Next: Output to connections,  Prev: Connections,  Up: Connections

6.1 Types of connections
========================

The most familiar type of connection will be a file, and file
connections are created by function `file'.  File connections can (if
the OS will allow it for the particular file) be opened for reading or
writing or appending, in text or binary mode.  In fact, files can be
opened for both reading and writing, and R keeps a separate file
position for reading and writing.

   Note that by default a connection is not opened when it is created.
The rule is that a function using a connection should open a connection
(needed) if the connection is not already open, and close a connection
after use if it opened it.  In brief, leave the connection in the state
you found it in.   There are generic functions `open' and `close' with
methods to explicitly open and close connections.

   Files compressed via the algorithm used by `gzip' can be used as
connections created by the function `gzfile', whereas files compressed
by `bzip2' can be used via `bzfile'.

   Unix programmers are used to dealing with special files `stdin',
`stdout' and `stderr'.   These exist as _terminal connections_ in R.
They may be normal files, but they might also refer to input from and
output to a GUI console.  (Even with the standard Unix R interface,
`stdin' refers to the lines submitted from `readline' rather than a
file.)

   The three terminal connections are always open, and cannot be opened
or closed.  `stdout' and `stderr' are conventionally used for normal
output and error messages respectively.  They may normally go to the
same place, but whereas normal output can be re-directed by a call to
`sink', error output is sent to `stderr' unless re-directed by `sink,
type="message")'.  Note carefully the language used here: the
connections cannot be re-directed, but output can be sent to other
connections.

   _Text connections_ are another source of input.  They allow R
character vectors to be read as if the lines were being read from a text
file.  A text connection is created and opened by a call to
`textConnection', which copies the current contents of the character
vector to an internal buffer at the time of creation.

   Text connections can also be used to capture R output to a character
vector.  `textConnection' can be asked to create a new character object
or append to an existing one, in both cases in the user's workspace.
The connection is opened by the call to `textConnection', and at all
times the complete lines output to the connection are available in the
R object.  Closing the connection writes any remaining output to a
final element of the character vector.

   _Pipes_ are a special form of file that connects to another process,
and pipe connections are created by the function `pipe'.  Opening a
pipe connection for writing (it makes no sense to append to a pipe)
runs an OS command, and connects its standard input to whatever R then
writes to that connection.  Conversely, opening a pipe connection for
input runs an OS command and makes its standard output available for R
input from that connection.

   URLs of types `http://', `ftp://' and `file://' can be read from
using the function `url'.  For convenience, `file' will also accept
these as the file specification and call `url'.

   Sockets can also be used as connections via function
`socketConnection' on platforms which support Berkeley-like sockets
(most Unix systems, Linux and Windows).  Sockets can be written to or
read from, and both client and server sockets can be used.


File: R-data.info,  Node: Output to connections,  Next: Input from connections,  Prev: Types of connections,  Up: Connections

6.2 Output to connections
=========================

We have described functions `cat', `write', `write.table' and `sink' as
writing to a file, possibly appending to a file if argument `append =
TRUE', and this is what they did prior to R version 1.2.0.

   The current behaviour is equivalent, but what actually happens is
that when the `file' argument is a character string, a file connection
is opened (for writing or appending) and closed again at the end of the
function call.  If we want to repeatedly write to the same file, it is
more efficient to explicitly declare and open the connection, and pass
the connection object to each call to an output function.  This also
makes it possible to write to pipes, which was implemented earlier in a
limited way via the syntax `file = "|cmd"' (which can still be used).

   There is a function `writeLines' to write complete text lines to a
connection.

   Some simple examples are

     zz <- file("ex.data", "w")  # open an output file connection
     cat("TITLE extra line", "2 3 5 7", "", "11 13 17",
         file = zz, sep = "\n")
     cat("One more line\n", file = zz)
     close(zz)

     ## convert decimal point to comma in output, using a pipe (Unix)
     ## both R strings and (probably) the shell need \ doubled
     zz <- pipe(paste("sed s/\\\\./,/ >", "outfile"), "w")
     cat(format(round(rnorm(100), 4)), sep = "\n", file = zz)
     close(zz)
     ## now look at the output file:
     file.show("outfile", delete.file = TRUE)

     ## capture R output: use examples from help(lm)
     zz <- textConnection("ex.lm.out", "w")
     sink(zz)
     example(lm, prompt.echo = "> ")
     sink()
     close(zz)
     ## now `ex.lm.out' contains the output for futher processing.
     ## Look at it by, e.g.,
     cat(ex.lm.out, sep = "\n")


File: R-data.info,  Node: Input from connections,  Next: Listing and manipulating connections,  Prev: Output to connections,  Up: Connections

6.3 Input from connections
==========================

The basic functions to read from connections are `scan' and
`readLines'.  These take a character string argument and open a file
connection for the duration of the function call, but explicitly
opening a file connection allows a file to be read sequentially in
different formats.

   Other functions that call `scan' can also make use of connections,
in particular `read.table'.

   Some simple examples are

     ## read in file created in last examples
     readLines("ex.data")
     unlink("ex.data")

     ## read listing of current directory (Unix)
     readLines(pipe("ls -1"))

     # remove trailing commas from an input file.
     # Suppose we are given a file `data' containing
     450, 390, 467, 654,  30, 542, 334, 432, 421,
     357, 497, 493, 550, 549, 467, 575, 578, 342,
     446, 547, 534, 495, 979, 479
     # Then read this by
     scan(pipe("sed -e s/,$// data"), sep=",")

   For convenience, if the `file' argument specifies a FTP or HTTP URL,
the URL is opened for reading via `url'.  Specifying files via
`file://foo.bar' is also allowed.

* Menu:

* Pushback::


File: R-data.info,  Node: Pushback,  Prev: Input from connections,  Up: Input from connections

6.3.1 Pushback
--------------

C programmers may be familiar with the `ungetc' function to push back a
character onto a text input stream.  R connections have the same idea
in a more powerful way, in that an (essentially) arbitrary number of
lines of text can be pushed back onto a connection via a call to
`pushBack'.

   Pushbacks operate as a stack, so a read request first uses each line
from the most recently pushbacked text, then those from earlier
pushbacks and finally reads from the connection itself.  Once a
pushbacked line is read completely, it is cleared.  The number of
pending lines pushed back can be found via a call to `pushBackLength'.  

   A simple example will show the idea.

     > zz <- textConnection(LETTERS)
     > readLines(zz, 2)
     [1] "A" "B"
     > scan(zz, "", 4)
     Read 4 items
     [1] "C" "D" "E" "F"
     > pushBack(c("aa", "bb"), zz)
     > scan(zz, "", 4)
     Read 4 items
     [1] "aa" "bb" "G"  "H"
     > close(zz)

   Pushback is only available for connections opened for input in text
mode.


File: R-data.info,  Node: Listing and manipulating connections,  Next: Binary connections,  Prev: Input from connections,  Up: Connections

6.4 Listing and manipulating connections
========================================

A summary of all the connections currently opened by the user can be
found by `showConnections()', and a summary of all connections,
including closed and terminal connections, by `showConnections(all =
TRUE)'

   The generic function `seek' can be used to read and (on some
connections) reset the current position for reading or writing.
Unfortunately it depends on OS facilities which may be unreliable (e.g.
with text files under Windows).  Function `isSeekable' reports if
`seek' can change the position on the connection given by its argument.

   The function `truncate' can be used to truncate a file opened for
writing at its current position.  It works only for `file' connections,
and is not implemented on all platforms.


File: R-data.info,  Node: Binary connections,  Prev: Listing and manipulating connections,  Up: Connections

6.5 Binary connections
======================

Functions `readBin' and `writeBin' read to and write from binary
connections.  A connection is opened in binary mode by appending `"b"'
to the mode specification, that is using mode `"rb"' for reading, and
mode `"wb"' or `"ab"' (where appropriate) for writing.  The functions
have arguments

     readBin(con, what, n = 1, size = NA, endian = .Platform$endian)
     writeBin(object, con, size = NA, endian = .Platform$endian)

   In each case `con' is a connection which will be opened if necessary
for the duration of the call, and if a character string is given it is
assumed to specify a file name.

   It is slightly simpler to describe writing, so we will do that first.
`object' should be an atomic vector object, that is a vector of mode
`numeric', `integer', `logical', `character', `complex' or `raw',
without attributes.  By default this is written to the file as a stream
of bytes exactly as it is represented in memory.

   `readBin' reads a stream of bytes from the file and interprets them
as a vector of mode given by `what'.  This can be either an object of
the appropriate mode (e.g. `what=integer()') or a character string
describing the mode (one of the five given in the previous paragraph or
`"double"' or `"int"').  Argument `n' specifies the maximum number of
vector elements to read from the connection: if fewer are available a
shorter vector will be returned.  Argument `signed' allows 1-byte and
2-byte integers to be read as signed (the default) or unsigned integers.

   The remaining two arguments are used to write or read data for
interchange with another program or another platform.  By default binary
data is transferred directly from memory to the connection or _vice
versa_.  This will not suffice if the data are to be transferred to a
machine with a different architecture, but between almost all R
platforms the only change needed is that of byte-order.  Common PCs
(`ix86'-based and `x86_64'-based machines), Compaq Alpha and Vaxen are
_little-endian_, whereas Sun Sparc, mc680x0 series, IBM R6000, SGI and
most others are _big-endian_.  (Network byte-order (as used by XDR,
eXternal Data Representation) is big-endian.)  To transfer to or from
other programs we may need to do more, for example to read 16-bit
integers or write single-precision real numbers.  This can be done
using the `size' argument, which (usually) allows sizes 1, 2, 4, 8 for
integers and logicals, and sizes 4, 8 and perhaps 12 or 16 for reals.
Transferring at different sizes can lose precision, and should not be
attempted for vectors containing `NA''s.

   Character strings are read and written in C format, that is as a
string of bytes terminated by a zero byte.  Functions `readChar' and
`writeChar' provide greater flexibility.

6.5.1 Special values
--------------------

Functions `readBin' and `writeBin' will pass missing and special
values, although this should not be attempted if a size change is
involved.

   The missing value for R logical and integer types is `INT_MIN', the
smallest representable `int' defined in the C header `limits.h',
normally corresponding to the bit pattern `0x80000000'.

   The representation of the special values for R numeric and complex
types is machine-dependent, and possibly also compiler-dependent.  The
simplest way to make use of them is to link an external application
against the standalone `Rmath' library which exports double constants
`NA_REAL', `R_PosInf' and `R_NegInf', and include the header `Rmath.h'
which defines the macros `ISNAN' and `R_FINITE'.

   If that is not possible, on all current platforms IEC 60559 (aka IEEE
754) arithmetic is used, so standard C facilities can be used to test
for or set `Inf', `-Inf' and `NaN' values.  On such platforms `NA' is
represented by the `NaN' value with low-word `0x7a2' (1954 in decimal).

   Character missing values are written as `NA', and there are no
provision to recognize character values as missing (as this can be done
by re-assigning them once read).

7 Network interfaces
********************

* Menu:

* Reading from sockets::
* Using download.file::
* CORBA interface::

   Some limited facilities are available to exchange data at a lower
level across network connections.


File: R-data.info,  Node: Reading from sockets,  Next: Using download.file,  Prev: Network interfaces,  Up: Network interfaces

7.1 Reading from sockets
========================

Base R comes with some facilities to communicate _via_ BSD sockets on
systems that support them (including the common Linux, Unix and Windows
ports of R).  One potential problem with using sockets is that these
facilities are often blocked for security reasons or to force the use
of Web caches, so these functions may be more useful on an intranet
than externally.  For new projects it is suggested that socket
connections are used instead.

   The earlier low-level interface is given by functions `make.socket',
`read.socket', `write.socket' and `close.socket'.


File: R-data.info,  Node: Using download.file,  Next: CORBA interface,  Prev: Reading from sockets,  Up: Network interfaces

7.2 Using `download.file'
=========================

Function `download.file' is provided to read a file from a Web resource
via FTP or HTTP and write it to a file.  Often this can be avoided, as
functions such as `read.table' and `scan' can read directly from a URL,
either by explicitly using `url' to open a connection, or implicitly
using it by giving a URL as the `file' argument.


File: R-data.info,  Node: CORBA interface,  Prev: Using download.file,  Up: Network interfaces

7.3 CORBA interface
===================

CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) is similar to DCOM,
allowing applications to call methods, or operations, in server objects
running in other applications, potentially programmed in different
languages and running on different machines.  There is a *CORBA*
package available from the Omegahat project (at
`http://www.omegahat.org/RSCORBA/'), currently for Unix but a Windows
version looks to be possible.

   This package allows R commands to be used to locate available CORBA
servers, query the methods they provide, and dynamically invoke methods
on these objects.  R values given as arguments in these calls are
exported in the call and made available to that operation invocation.
Primitive data types (vectors and lists) are exported by default, while
more complex objects are exported by reference.  Examples of using this
include communicating with the Gnumeric (`http://www.gnumeric.org')
spreadsheet, and also interacting with the data visualization system
ggobi (http://www.ggobi.org).

   One can also create CORBA servers within R, allowing other
applications to call these methods.  For example, one might offer access
to a particular dataset or to some of R's modelling software.  This is
done dynamically by combining R data objects and functions.  This
allows one to explicitly export data and functionality from R.

   One can also use the *CORBA* package to achieve distributed,
parallel computing in R.  One R session acts as a manager and
dispatches tasks to different servers running in other R worker
sessions.  This uses the ability to invoke asynchronous or background
CORBA calls in R.  More information is available from the Omegahat
project at `http://www.omegahat.org/RSCORBA/'.

8 Reading Excel spreadsheets
****************************

The most common R data import/export question seems to be `how do I read
an Excel spreadsheet'.  This chapter collects together advice and
options given earlier.  Note that most of the advice is for pre-Excel
2007 spreadsheets and not the later `.xlsx' format.

   The first piece of advice is to avoid doing so if possible!  If you
have access to Excel, export the data you want from Excel in
tab-delimited or comma-separated form, and use `read.delim' or
`read.csv' to import it into R.  (You may need to use `read.delim2' or
`read.csv2' in a locale that uses comma as the decimal point.)
Exporting a DIF file and reading it using `read.DIF' is another
possibility.

   If you do not have Excel, many other programs are able to read such
spreadsheets and export in a text format on both Windows and Unix, for
example Gnumeric (`http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnumeric/') and
OpenOffice (`http://www.openoffice.org').  You can also cut-and-paste
between the display of a spreadsheet in such a program and R:
`read.table' will read from the R console or, under Windows, from the
clipboard (via `file = "clipboard"' or `readClipboard').  The
`read.DIF' function can also read from the clipboard.

   Note that an Excel `.xls' file is not just a spreadsheet: such files
can contain many sheets, and the sheets can contain formulae, macros
and so on.  Not all readers can read other than the first sheet, and
may be confused by other contents of the file.

   Windows users (of 32-bit R) can use `odbcConnectExcel' in package
*RODBC* (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RODBC).  This can select
rows and columns from any of the sheets in an Excel spreadsheet file
(at least from Excel 97-2003, depending on your ODBC drivers: by
calling `odbcConnect' directly versions back to Excel 3.0 can be read).
The version `odbcConnectExcel2007' will read the Excel 2007 formats as
well as earlier ones (provided the drivers are installed, including
with 64-bit Windows R: *note RODBC::).  Mac users can also use *RODBC*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RODBC) if they have a suitable
driver (e.g. that from Actual Technologies).

   `Perl' users have contributed a module
`OLE::SpreadSheet::ParseExcel' and a program `xls2csv.pl' to convert
Excel 95-2003 spreadsheets to CSV files.  Package *gdata*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gdata) provides a basic wrapper in
its `read.xls' function.  With suitable `Perl' modules installed this
function can also read Excel 2007 spreadsheets.

   32-bit Windows package *xlsReadWrite*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=xlsReadWrite) from
`http://www.swissr.org/' and CRAN has a function `read.xls' to read
`.xls' files (based on a third-party non-Open-Source Delphi component).

   Packages *dataframes2xls*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dataframes2xls) and *WriteXLS*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=WriteXLS) each contain a function to
_write_ one or more data frames to an `.xls' file, using Python and
Perl respectively.  Another version of `write.xls' in available in
package *xlsReadWrite* (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=xlsReadWrite).

   Two packages which can read and and manipulate Excel 2007/10
spreadsheets but not earlier formats are *xlsx*
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=xlsx) (which requires Java) and the
Omegahat package *RExcelXML*.

   Package *XLConnect* (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=XLConnect)
can read, write and manipulate both Excel 97-2003 and Excel 2007/10
spreadsheets, requiring Java.
